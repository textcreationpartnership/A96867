            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> having already acquainted thee with the time when it was preached, I ſhall only give thee a more faithful account of the occaſion of preaching it, and of ſome paſſages in it. The Providence of God, which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all our wayes and motions, directed me to the City of <hi>New Sarum</hi> at ſuch a time, when it fell to Mr. <hi>Thomas War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> turne to preach the weekly Lecture there; whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, (as it well deſerves) is ſince printed; and in it thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reade thoſe certain, neceſſary and important truths which he then inſiſted on. Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> withſtood him vehemently, not without the great diſturbance and grief of many, to whom the Word of Truth is precious and amiable. I had formerly been a Preacher in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore againſt my will, by the ſurprizal of a Chronical diſtemper, which
<pb facs="tcp:116045:3"/> gave time and occaſion to many of my acquaintance to viſit me, and to deſire me, (as I then could) to ſet my ſeal pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie to the truth of the Goſpel, which accordingly I did in that Sermon, which is here vindicated againſt Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> I was earneſtly importuned by many worthy Miniſters &amp; Chriſtians to print my Sermon; whoſe deſires nevertheleſſe, I refuſed to gratifie; partly, becauſe I could not be wrought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of it, as they did: principally, out of reſpect to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf whoſe weakneſſes I was unwilling ſhould be made ſo publick by my meanes. One Copy indeed I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the private uſe of ſome Chriſtians, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglie, when I was returned home, I wrote haſtily, and ſent to them, reſerving no Tranſcript of it in my own hands. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome weeks, (how many, I cannot now juſtly tell) I was informed, that they, who had the peruſal of that Copy, were reſolved to ſend it up to <hi>London;</hi> and if it found the like Approbation there, as in the Countrey, to commit it to the Preſſe: When I heard this, conſidering how many judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters had ſolicited me to print it, and how many more might paſſe judgement upon it before it ſhould be printed; I was reſolved to meddle nor make no more in the buſineſſe, but leave it wholly to the judgment of others; which I ſpeak for the vindication of Reverend Mr. <hi>Cranford,</hi> (who was pleaſed to give himſelf the trouble of prefixing an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to my Sermon; for which reſpect to me, then altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtranger to him (as I yet alſo am, having never ſeen his face, nor he mine, as I know of) I do hereby return him that acknowledgement which I owe him) when he tells the Reader, that it was not by my meanes that my Sermon was printed. And whoſoever he was that aſſured * Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> of<note place="margin">In his book p. 38.</note> any other hand that I had in the printing of the ſaid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, then as I have here related, ſpake without book.</p>
            <p>Soon after the printing of mine, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> publiſhed a
<pb facs="tcp:116045:3"/> Sermon of his own preached at the following Aſſizes. In his Epiſtle to the Reader he complains much of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian language, eſpecially that I ſhould ſay he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperous; and produceth a Certificate under ſix witneſſes hands, living (as I am informed, for I know not all the men) in the County of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sarum,</hi> of his ſaire deportment in that oppoſition which he made againſt me in the publick meeting-place, after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended. I acknowledge the word to be ſomewhat homely, and ſuch as if I had printed againſt Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> I ſhould have forborne; and ſeeing it gives him ſuch offence, do publikely recant it; (for, it is not only there, but, as I remember, thrice in his book that he takes notice of it, with a moſt ſufficient <hi>Talio,</hi>) Nevertheleſſe, if he will give it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other terme, I ſhall own the accuſation, and be content that it be tried by number of witneſſes too. I do therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee (Reader) that many Chriſtians in that City, (whom Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would heretofore have accounted worthy of belief, though now I think he will allow them no better teſtimony then that they go for <hi>Profeſſours</hi>) having conſidered in what formalitie Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proceeded againſt me, took themſelves bound in conſcience to teſtifie what they had ſeen and known, and ſent me of their own accord a large letter, ſubſcribed with all their hands, (which were very many more then thoſe which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> procured to certifie for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed to ſome of my neighbouring Miniſters, that they might be my witneſſes, (if called thereto) that I report the truth. Yet, though I acknowledge my ſelf beholding to them that ſent me the letter, for their love and reſpects to me, I will by no means make uſe of their teſtimony; as
<pb facs="tcp:116045:4"/> not eſteeming my credit worthy to be redeemed with the leaſt damage that may befal them, by the evil eye of others on the weather-ſide of them.</p>
            <p>But out of my own mouth will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> condemn me; becauſe when he brake off the conference, I uſed thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 4. 12. Be ye as I am, for I am as you are; you have not wronged me at all;</hi> which words I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, when I ſpake them in no other ſenſe then Dr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it is ſomewhat ſtrange to me, to obſerve what meaſure Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> meteth to all that cannot vaile to his judgement. If Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> lay down principles inconſiſtent with his, he muſt be repreſented as an Arminian, a Papiſt, a Socinian, and what not? If a faithful Chriſtian, (and that in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> own judgement, though none of the meaneſt rank of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians neither) do but ask him a queſtion, and that with all due reſpect, he muſt be bid to <note n="f" place="margin">Page 9, 10.</note>—I will not engliſh the words for very ſhame.

<pb facs="tcp:116045:4"/> will never be believed after ſuch premiſes; nor will they be any ſalve for ſuch a publick putting to ſhame, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the face of a member of Chriſt. If my brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf againſt his notions, he muſt be <note n="g" place="margin">Page 84.</note> printed as a deſertor of his Church in <hi>New-England,</hi> for the love of a better Parſonage in old. <hi>Durus Sermo</hi> I could name many Miniſters, that ſince theſe times have returned from thence hither, and have gained ten times more by their return then my brother hath, or is ever like to do; were they all deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their Churches for fatter morſels? If a man ſhould print of Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that he is of late grown an enemy to <note n="h" place="margin">Epiſt dedic. the Councel of War before his Sermon.</note> Tithes, that (if they be ſold) he might adde ſome of them to his former Purchaſes: or if they be put into a publick treaſury, he might take of them more liberally, in the more reformed way of a State maintenance; or becauſe he envies bread to every Miniſter that cannot hold pace with him in the way he goes, and would have them all at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: If (I ſay) a man ſhould print theſe things of Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> I ſhould verily account him a ſlanderer, unleſſe he were able to prove it better, then (I am ſure) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> can prove his charge againſt my brother. He findes fault with my brothers argument, becauſe <hi>de occultis non judicat Eccleſia:</hi> and yet is his own practice faultleſſe, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which the Church may not judge of, I mean the intentions of a mans heart? It concernes not me to praiſe my brother; his own innocency in many yeares Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, is a ſufficient defence to him againſt a thouſand ſuch calumniations; nor is he mindful to take ſo much notice of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> language, as to give him an anſwer; but content, without envying Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> his great yearly revenews, to ſerve God with chearfulneſſe in his poverty; only for his arguments, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath taken them up upon truſt, (which was not faire dealing)
<pb facs="tcp:116045:5"/> and his informer hath miſrepreſented them. I had them, and a Vindication of them under my brothers hand, and was intended to have printed them, as not fearing what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> or any man elſe could rationally have excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: but finding my book to be of it ſelfe growen beyond that proportion which I intended, I have omitted it.</p>
            <p>In his anſwer to me, (to leave theſe perſonal matters, which can be neither grateful nor profitable to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) how often be daſheth himſelf againſt himſelf; and in the whole ſcope of his Diſcourſe, oppoſeth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the body of Proteſtant Divines, the Reader may in ſome meaſure ſee in this Reply. So little cauſe hath he to charge the doctrine, which my ſelf or others maintain againſt him, with a compliance with Popery.

As for his other charge of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme, the Lord knowes, and my own ſoul knows, to my daily ſhame and ſorrow, I have as little reaſon as any man to expect Juſtification in a Popiſh or Arminian
<pb facs="tcp:116045:5"/> way.

            <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> alledgeth the teſtimonies of ſome Divines, as ſpeaking ſeemingly for him. But that the ſame Divines do elſewhere more plainly ſpeak againſt him, hath been ſo fully evidenced by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> and bleſſed Mr. <hi>Graile,</hi> that I cannot account it worth while to take a particular view of his teſtimonies. Only I intended to take ſome ſpecial notice of two of his Authors, <hi>viz. Robert Parker,</hi> (my Reverend Grandfather,) and renowned Dr. <hi>Twiſſe.</hi> As to that paſſage which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath picked out of my Grandfathers book, <hi>De deſcenſu Chriſti ad inferos,</hi> it hath been already ſo cleared both by Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that I am perſwaded if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> were to write his book again, he would quit the hold he takes on thoſe words. Much leſſe would he have declared ſo tragically againſt me, as if I had no leſſe then juſtified my Grandfathers perſecutors in all their injurious and unworthy dealings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, in writing for that truth which he never denied. But if I do anything unworthy of the name and memory of that Reverend man, (who yet was never perſecuted for his book <hi>De deſcenſu;</hi> much leſſe for being ſuppoſed to be an abettor of the Juſtification of impenitent and unbelieving ſinners,) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> might have thought it no greater fault in me, then in his own and only ſonne, my Reverend and much honoured Uncle Mr. <hi>Thomas Parker, (vir omni ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione
<pb facs="tcp:116045:6"/> major</hi>) who hath taught me long ſince, that <note n="o" place="margin">De traduct. peccat. ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam. theſ. 5. 6.</note>

As for Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> if he were capable of receiving any addition of honour by my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, I ſhould be more ambitious to perform it then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> could be deſirous of the favour of his <note n="p" place="margin">Ep. dedic.</note>

            <p>Something I ſhould alſoſpeak concerning Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal quotations, which are many of them falſe, as I was once intended to have ſhewed the Reader in a Liſt. But conſidering that the difference of Volumes or Editions, in which his Authors are extant, may breed a miſtake of ſome; and that the Printer tells us, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> was not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the Preſſe; and ſo through the errour of that, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might be miſtaken, I have thought fit to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for this my Reply, though the Authors above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and Mr. <hi>Eedes</hi> beſides, (who yet hath miſrepreſented me, in reporting that I deny faith to be an evidence of our Juſtification) coming all out ſo long before me, may ſeem to make my undertaking needleſſe; yet I was loth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the expectations of ſo many, as had ſo long waited for my Reply. The truth is, I had ſoon drawn up the ſumme of my anſwer, ſo far as I was ſure that I underſtood Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:116045:6"/> aright. That I made no more haſte to the Preſſe, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were, 1. The inceſſant emploiments I have had, both at home and abroad, which have made me uncapable of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing works of this nature ſo cloſe as they ſhould be. 2. The frequent and long-continuing bodily infirmities, which have kept me from writing many weeks together. 3. While the controverſie was hot, I was willing to ſee whether any thing would come out <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> that might occaſion any new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. I hear of none but Mr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> (who threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with a few pedantick Scoticiſmes) and Mr. <hi>Crandon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whom (for the report I had heard of the man) I greedily deſired to reade. But lighting by accident upon his diſcourſe, about the afflictions which befal the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life. I found him <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> and ſo leave him to thoſe Readers, who can be edified by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Comment upon the title page of my Sermon I paſſe over. His digreſſion in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. about publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the Miniſters, will have ſome more cautions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it paſſe for canonical, if ever it be his lot to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that way, as much as ſome worthy Miniſters have been, in ſome Churches which I have known. In my Reply to his Arguments I have faithfully ſet down the ſtrength of his argument, though not every word in every place. And ſo (Reader) I commend thee, and this my writing, unto the bleſſing of him, who will one day owne it for his truth, and thee for a childe of truth, if thou walk in it.</p>

I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116045:8"/> firſt examine thoſe two Chapters (beginning here with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) and ſo proceed to the entire Vindication of my Sermon by it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtating of the Queſtion, theſe three things are to be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. What <hi>Juſtification</hi> is? 2. What it is to be juſtified by <hi>Faith:</hi> or what is the office of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Juſtification?</hi> 3. What is meant by the phraſe <hi>In the ſight of God,</hi> or <hi>before God,</hi> when we enquire concerning the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of a ſinner before God, or in Gods ſight?</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, when we enquire what <hi>Juſtification</hi> is, it is ſuppoſed<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that the word <hi>Juſtification</hi> is taken properly, <hi>&amp; in ſenſu formali,</hi> not in a diminutive, comparative or tropical ſenſe, <hi>Analogum per ſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſtat pro famoſiori ſignificato.</hi> The Reaſon why I obſerve this, is, becauſe Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> pretends to his Reader, that I have no leſſe then yielded the cauſe, when I grant a <hi>Juſtification</hi> purpoſed of God, and merited by Chriſt before <hi>Faith:</hi> So then (ſaith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 147.) by his own confeſſion, <q>
                        <hi>Juſtification</hi> in a Scripture ſenſe goes before <hi>Faith:</hi> which is that horrid opinion he hath all this while ſo eagerly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>&amp; pag.</hi> 101. challengeth ſome one text of Scripture to prove that <hi>Juſtification</hi> doth in no ſenſe precede the act of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas I doubt not but the world may be ſaid to be from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>in ſome ſenſe,</hi> namely in reference to the counſel and purpoſe of God. And he that is never juſtified at all, ſimply, may yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be ſaid to be juſtified <hi>in ſome ſenſe,</hi> that is, comparatively, as being leſſe unjuſt then another, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 11. And many of thoſe who are now alive, and never yet taſted of death, may nevertheleſſe be ſaid to be already riſen from the dead <hi>in ſome ſenſe,</hi> to wit, in Chriſt, the firſt fruits of them that ſlept. And <hi>Juſtification</hi> it ſelf may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led condemnation <hi>in ſome ſenſe</hi> for the Scots ſay a man is juſtified when he is hanged: and the word ſeemes to be uſed in a ſenſe not much unlike, <hi>Rom. 6. 7. He that is dead, is juſtified from ſinne.</hi> If Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> do indeed think (which I am perſwaded he doth not) that the Queſtion between him and me is, whether the wit of man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome ſenſe wherein <hi>Juſtification</hi> may be ſaid to go before <hi>Faith:</hi> he ſhould have acquainted his Reader with it here, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherein the particular nature and formality of this glorious bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of <hi>Juſtification</hi> doth conſiſt, is more particularly debated in the following diſcourſe. Yet that the Reader may know what <hi>Juſtification</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116045:8"/> it is which we ſpeak of, I ſhal here ſpeak ſomething briefly for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: leaving whatſoever is controverted, to be proved in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. <hi>Juſtification</hi> then by our late Reverend <note n="a" place="margin">Larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. <hi>pag</hi> 94. in 12.</note> Aſſembly is thus defined. An act of Gods free-grace unto ſinners, in which he pardoneth all their ſinnes, accepteth and accounteth their perſons righteous in his ſight, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but only for the perfect obedience and full ſatisfaction of Chriſt, by God imputed to them, and received by <hi>Faith</hi> alone. This for ſubſtance, is the <hi>Juſtification</hi> which the Queſtion ſpeaks of: if thou wouldeſt have it (Reader) more particularly, take it as followeth.</p>
                  <p>The efficient (<hi>ut quod</hi>) of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> is God himſelf that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth:<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> and his grace the efficient <hi>ut quo,</hi> for he juſtifies us freely of his grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. Jeſus Chriſt alſo as King and Lord of life, is joyned by ſpecial commiſſion with the Father in his great Act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying ſinners, <hi>John 5. 22. 26, 27. Acts 5. 31. Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. The righteouſneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Jeſus Chriſt is the onely meritorious cauſe of our <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but whether his active or paſſive obedience, either, or both, I do not diſpute, nor do I account it needful: becauſe all the active o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt was paſſive (for it was part of his humiliation, that being <note n="b" place="margin">See Bp. <hi>Uſher.</hi> Imman. <hi>pag.</hi> 10, at the end of his Body of Divinity.</note> a Son, he would ſubject himſelf to the payment of that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of obedience which was due onely from ſervants) and all his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience was active: for he laid down his life of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10. 18. The formality of <hi>Juſtification</hi> conſiſts (as I take it) in a legal diſcharge of a ſinner from his obligation to puniſhment, and a dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right and title to eternal life: which diſcharge and gift, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was merited by the obedience of Chriſt, without any contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of merit from the ſinner himſelf, is truly called the <note n="c" place="margin">Chriſti juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione fidelibus imputatur, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus ejus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito juſti co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Deo repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamur. <hi>Ameſ.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116045:9"/> upon whom we reſt for life and righteouſneſſe. Secondly, of thoſe which ſay we are juſtified by <hi>Faith</hi> inſtrumentally and relatively. Thirdly, Of the Papiſts, who aſcribe a meritoriouſneſſe to <hi>Faith,</hi> and do alſo make our <hi>Juſtification</hi> to be by inherent righteouſneſſe, or doing of righteous actions. Foutthly, of the Arminians who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the word Merit, and deliver their opinion to this effect. That God in the legal Covenant required the exact obedience of all his Commandments: but now in the Covenant of Grace he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>Faith;</hi> which in his gracious acceptation ſtands inſtead of that obedience to the Moral Law, which we ought to performe. Fifthly, of thoſe that ſay that <hi>Faith</hi> doth juſtifie as a condition or Antecedent qualification, by which we are made capable of being juſtified according to the order and conſtitution of God.</q>

                     <q>My ſenſe of this Propoſition (<hi>we are juſtified by Faith</hi>) is no other then what hath been given by all our ancient Proteſtant Divines, who take <hi>Faith</hi> herein objectively, not properly, and explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this effect. We are juſtified from all ſinne and death by the ſatisfaction and obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the ſole object or foundation of our faith: or, whoſe righteouſneſſe we receive and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our ſelves by <hi>Faith.</hi> Yet I ſay, it doth not follow that it was not applyed to us by God, or that God did not impute righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us before we had <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had concluded as he began, leaving out the exception which brings up the rear, and underſtanding our ancient Proteſtants in their known ſenſe: this one ſentence had confuted all his book, and ſaved me the pains of ſuch an undertaking. It is moſt true, that our Proteſtants maintaine that we are juſtified by the obedience of Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe of our <hi>Juſtification:</hi> and it is as true, that they maintaine a ſinner to be juſtified by <hi>Faith</hi> as the inſtrument or condition of his juſtification. Nor can I finde one amongſt the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Proteſtants, that did ever dreame of a <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt without <hi>Faith:</hi> no, though for the moſt part they place <hi>Faith</hi> in a particular aſſurance.

                     </gap>, in the day of judgement. Accordingly, my opinion is, that a ſinner is juſtified in Gods ſight, either <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> by the Law or Conſtitution of grace, the immediate effect whereof is to give the ſinner a right to impunity, and to the heavenly inheritance; or by the ſentence of the Judge at the laſt day, by which he is adjudged unto the immediate, full and perfect poſſeſſion of all thoſe immunities and bleſſings, which were given him in right by that grand Promiſe of the Goſpel, <hi>John. 3. 16. He that believeth on me, ſhall not periſh; but ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> Even as amongſt men, an Act of grace and pardon gives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned rebels a right to deliverance from their preſent, and legally future puniſhments: though the effects of this right he do not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe (any otherwiſe then in hope) till his cauſe be tried, and himſelf abſolved in Court, by the ſentence of the Judge. In reference to the former, a ſinner is juſtified preſently upon believing: in reference to the latter, he is not juſtified till the day of judgement. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts the Jewes to repentance, that their ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the Preſence of God, <hi>And he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 3. 19, 20. And <hi>Paul</hi> prays for <hi>Oneſiphorus, that God would grant him, that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 18. which (queſtionleſſe) is meant of the day of judgement: of which himſelfe alſo ſpeaks a little before, <hi>ver. 12.

                  <p>To which, I ſhall need to give no other anſwer then his own words, in the ſame paragraph: of the laſt thus he ſpeaks. <q>This phraſe muſt have ſome other meaning in this debate: for elſe that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Juſtification <hi>in foro Dei, &amp; in foro Conſcientiae,</hi> would be a meer tautology. Of the firſt thus. Although <hi>in articulo Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> in the doctrine of divine Providence, ſeeing and knowing are all one: yet <hi>in articulo Juſtificationis,</hi> in the doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are conſtantly diſtinguiſhed throughout the Scripture, and never promiſcuouſly uſed, the one for the other.</q> Thus of three ſenſes of the phraſe, himſelfe rejects two, as impertinent to the matter in hand, and yet ſtates his anſwer thus. <q>If we take Gods ſight in the laſt conſtruction, (<hi>viz.</hi> for his making us to ſee) then we are not juſtified in Gods ſight before we believe. 2. If we referre it to the juſtice of God, we were juſtified in the ſight of God, when Chriſt exhibited, and God accepted the full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his blood. 3. If we referre it to the knowledge of God, we were juſtified in his ſight, when he willed or determined in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not to impute to us our ſins, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As who ſhould ſay, If you take Gods ſight in ſuch a ſenſe, in which it is never taken in all the Scripture, by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (ſuch is the firſt ſenſe, which is here the laſt) then thus. But if you take it in ſuch a ſenſe, in which it may not be taken in the preſent queſtion (ſuch is the laſt of the three, which is here put firſt) then ſo. If ſome other ſenſes of the ſight of God, (as when it ſignifies his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, his aſſiſtance, his approbation and witneſſing, &amp;c.) had been ſet down, that we might have known when we are juſtified in Gods ſight, in thoſe ſenſes; it had been every whit as conducible to the clearing of the Queſtion. As firſt, to tell us, that Gods ſight doth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116045:13"/> never ſignifie his knowledge in the matter of Juſtification; and then to adde in the ſame breath, that to be juſtified in Gods ſight, is to be juſtified in his knowledge. 2. Nor is it a lawful diſtinction, becauſe the members thereof do interferre, for Juſtification in the death of Chriſt; and in our own conſciences, is Juſtification in Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for ſurely he knows both theſe no leſſe then his Purpoſe and Determination within himſelfe. 3. We ſhall ſee by and by, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> maintaines, that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to ſinners, by the eternal Act of Gods Will: I ask then, whether that imputation be Juſtification in Gods legal juſtice? if it be; then there is a farther implication in the members of the diſtinction: if it be not, I would know how God doth juſtifie us in his legal juſtice, and yet not by imputing the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to us. 4. God knows us not to be juſtified till we be juſtified, for it is impoſſible that the ſame thing ſhould be and not be. Indeed he may well know, that he intends to juſtifie us; but if he know that, then he knows we are not yet juſtified: for he knows that what he intends to do is not yet done.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> refers us to his following diſcourſe; for the better underſtanding of theſe myſteries, I attend his motion, that I may ſpare tautologies as much as I can.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is the foundation of all the following obſcure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: which I perceive Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had rather we ſhould take for granted, then he be put to prove. I do therefore deny</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Juſtification doth any where in Scripture ſignifie Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Will or Purpoſe not to puniſh: of which more, preſently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is any where in Scripture put <hi>pro re volitâ,</hi> for the thing willed, formally, and under that habitude or relation. Juſtification is the diſcharge of a ſinner from his obligation to puniſhment: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were willed or not willed from eternity, is but extrinſecal and accidental to the Act it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Juſtification is any where uſed in Scripture for the effects of Juſtification: though I deny no man the liberty of making uſe ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of ſuch a trope: but we are now enquiring <hi>de nomine,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſe of the Word. The Apoſtle makes that one Act of Election the cauſe of all ſpiritual bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. of which our Juſtification is one, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. no leſſe then Adoption, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. which is an Act of the ſame common nature with Juſtification, and by ſome eminent <note n="d" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Reignolds</hi> Life of Chriſt <hi>page 402.</hi>
                     </note> Divines made a part of it: and that ſuitably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Scripture phraſe, even when it is made conſequent to our faith, <hi>John 1. 12. Gal.</hi> 3. 25. with 4. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our diſcharge from the curſe is, either our diſcharge from an obligation to it, or from our actual ſuffering it. In this latter ſenſe it is indeed an effect of Juſtification, but in the former ſenſe it is the very life, being and forme of it, unleſſe it be underſtood paſſively, and ſo that alſo may be called an effect of Juſtification: becauſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect of a diſcharge active, is a perſon diſcharged. Theſe obſervations (<hi>Reader</hi>) thou wilt finde uſeful, in the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
                  <p>That abſurd conceit (as he calls it) that ſome have inferred upon<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> an eternal Juſtification, (<hi>viz.</hi> that then Chriſt came not to ſatisfie the juſtice, but only to manifeſt the love of God) is ſo natural a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his doctrine, that it will never be put off with a cold <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur.</hi> And I preſume Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is not ignorant, that it is a maine principle, upon which the Socinians deny the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. And if he will owne what himſelfe hath wrote in this book, he muſt joyne with them. He affirmes, that Gods eternal Will not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116045:14"/> is the very eſſence of Juſtification, <hi>page</hi> 64. 2. That by this Will men are ſecured from wrath, and diſcharged and acquitted from their ſins, that it is a real diſcharge from condemnation, an actual and compleat non-imputation of ſin, <hi>page</hi> 67. §, 6. upon which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, I demand, Whoſe debt did Chriſt pay? his own? That's little leſſe then blaſphemy.

                  <p>The next groſſe miſtake which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells us ſome have faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> upon the doctrine of eternal Juſtification is theirs, who upon this ground have aſſerted the eternal being of the creature, thus. <hi>If men are juſtified from eternity, they are from eternity.</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath well removed this conſequence, if his principle be good, that <hi>eſſe juſtificatum</hi> is a terme of diminution. But verily, if the Scriptures have rightly informed us in the nature of Juſtification, I do not ſee how the conſequence can be avoided, for Juſtification is one of the moſt eminent bleſſings contained in that Promiſe, <hi>I will be their God.</hi> So <hi>Paul, Rom. 3. 29, 30. Is he the God of the Jewes only, and not of the Gentiles alſo? yea, of the Gentiles alſo: ſeeing it is one God, who ſhall juſtifie the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith. Now God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:116045:14"/> Matth. 22. 32. And if not the God of the dead (who yet live as to their ſoules) then much leſſe is he the God of them that are not, nor never were. <hi>Ergo</hi> he doth not juſtifie them that are not. Again, <hi>He that is juſtified is bleſſed,</hi> Rom. 4. And he that is bleſſed from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is from eternity: for he that is not, is neither bleſſed nor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. To ſay, he is bleſſed from eternity in Gods intention, is no more, then that there was a preparation of bleſſedneſſe for him in Gods intention: which I readily grant, and it profits Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But it little concernes me to make good the foreſaid conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: ſomething more of it the Reader ſhall finde a little below; in the mean time we come to the great Queſtion, whether Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation conſiſt formally in the Will or Purpoſe of God, not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh?</p>

                  <p>THe Will of God, as Divines are wont to diſtinguiſh, is either<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> or <hi>voluntas ſigni.</hi> The former is the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Decree or Purpoſe of God, concerning ſome Act of his owne, to be done by himſelfe in his due time. The latter (to confine it to our preſent uſe) is his ſignal, legiſlative, revealed, royal Will, by which he determines as ſupream Governour of the world, what ſhall be our duty to do or not to do, and what ſhall be due to us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our doing or not doing of this Will. Hence the Word and Lawes of God are called in Scripture <hi>his Will,</hi> in hundreds of places. By this Will of God doth he give Believers a right to impunity, which is their proper Juſtification: whereof his not puniſhing them <hi>de facto</hi> is the effect. This I ſhall prove (God willing) when I come to the vindication of my firſt Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> In the meane time, the thing which he undertakes to prove is, That the very eſſence and quiddity of a ſinners Juſtification, is Gods Decree or Purpoſe from eternity not to puniſh him. I deny it, and ſhall ſubjoyne ſome reaſons againſt it by and by, beſides thoſe which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in his book.

                  <p>
                     <q>Juſtification is Gods non-imputing of ſin, and imputing of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to a perſon, <hi>Pſal. 32. 1, 2. Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 8. but Gods Will not to puniſh a perſon, is his non-imputing ſin to him.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:116045:15"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant the <hi>major,</hi> but I do very much long to ſee what<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> definition Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will give of Juſtification, that may include Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Gods knowledge, and in his legal juſtice, and in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that I might know whether theſe three be three ſeveral ſorts, or only three degrees of one and the ſame Juſtification, but let that paſſe. I deny the <hi>minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For proof of it Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> appeales to the Original words, both Greek and Hebrew, both which (ſaith he) doth ſignifie an act of the minde or will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is to prove, that they ſignifie the purpoſe or reſolution of the will: in which ſenſe they appear, not ſo much as once, neither in the Hebrew, nor in the Greek Interpreters: nor do our Tranſlators render them at any time in ſuch a ſenſe: and therefore that obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have been ſpared. 2. An act of the underſtanding they ſignifie often: but it is ſuch an act as will not endure to be called by the name of imputation, but thinking, deviſing, eſteeming, or the like: for example, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the LXX. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. We render it. Neither doth his heart think ſo. Nor doth common ſenſe permit that it be rendred. <hi>Neither doth his heart impute ſe.</hi> In like manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 7. Againſt me do they <hi>deviſe</hi> my hurt: where the words are the ſame, both in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and the Septuagint. And cannot be rendered, <hi>Againſt me do they impute my hurt.</hi> So <hi>Iſa. 53. 3. He was deſpiſed, and we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not,</hi> (where the words are ſtill the ſame.) It would be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſenſe, to render them, <hi>He was deſpiſed, and we imputed him not.</hi> Multitudes of like inſtances might be given. But when the words will beare to be grammatically rendered by the name of Imputation, they then ſignifie, not an immanent act of the underſtanding or will, but a tranſient act, containing an <hi>objectum Quod,</hi> or ſomething that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; and an <hi>objectum cui,</hi> ſome perſon to whom it is imputed: who alſo is thereby changed phyſically or morally. And thus the word imputation is uſed in Scripture. 1. When by Law one thing paſſeth in ſtead of another, <hi>Numb. 18. 27, 30. This your heave-offering ſhall be reckoned</hi> (or imputed) <hi>to you, as though it were the corne of the threſhing ſlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When you have heaved the beſt thereof from it, then it ſhall be counted,</hi> (or imputed) <hi>to the Levites, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the threſhing floore, &amp;c.</hi> Not that the ſaid heave-offering was eſteemed or thought to be the corne of the threſhing floore: (for that had been a fiction, or an errour and imperfection of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) but becauſe by the determination of the Law, it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116045:15"/> made equivalent thereunto, or equally available to all effects and purpoſes. This is a tranſient act. 2. When a man is charged as the Authour of ſuch or ſuch a fact, 2 <hi>Sam. 3. 8. Imputas mihi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitatem hujus mulieris. Junius.</hi> This alſo is a tranſient act. 3. The giving of a reward to a man, whether the reward be of debt or of grace, is Imputation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. and to puniſh ſin is to impute ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19. becauſe puniſhment is the wages of ſin, and not to puniſh ſin when puniſhment is due by Law, is the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. and when the Law denies a man that benefit of an action, which otherwiſe he might have expected, that action is ſaid to be non-imputed to him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 18. It ſhall not be accepted, neither ſhall it be imputed to him. This alſo is a tranſient act. In the ſame ſenſe is the word uſed in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Righteouſneſſe ſhall be imputed to us if we beleeve,</hi> Rom. 4. 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Beza.</hi> (Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> gloſſe upon that text we ſhall meet with in due place) and <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for them that deſerted him in his troubles, that their ſin may not be imputed to them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. in both which places imputation expreſſeth a future act, and therefore cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of an immanent eternal act of God. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. of which more hereafter. So that I may very well retort Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Argument upon himſelf. If Juſtification be a non-imputation of ſin, then it is a tranſient act (and not an immanent act of Gods Will.) But the firſt is true, <hi>ex conceſſis. Ergo</hi> ſo is the laſt. And I wonder Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould nor foreſee the weakneſſe of his proofe. The original words note an immanent act, when they ſignifie ſome other thing then imputation: <hi>Ergo</hi> imputation is an immanent act. So much for the firſt Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſecond is this: that which doth ſecure men from wrath, and whereby they are diſcharged and acquitted from their ſins, is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.

Nor was there any need, as to our Juſtification, that he

We are ſecured from wrath before, ſayes Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> 4. Our preaching is vain: for we are to preach to every creature under Heaven, <hi>That except they beleeve, they ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 15, 16. and multitudes (even all the Elect) are ſecured from wrath before. 5. It doth alſo imply a contradiction, that a man ſhould be acquitted from ſin, who was never a ſinner: or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from condemnation, who was never condemned. If it be ſaid, the Elect were ſinners, and condemned in Gods fore-knowledge: Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is better read in Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> then to be ignorant of what inextricable inconveniences that anſwer is liable to. But let us heare Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> proofes of his Aſſumption: <q>God (ſaith he) loved the Elect from everlaſting, and his love is <hi>velle dare bonum, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Which (as was obſerved before) is one of the <note n="g" place="margin">Vid. Croll. Cont.

A love of benevolence or good will, moving God to ſeek out a way of ſatisfaction to his own Juſtice, and of Juſtification of a ſinner, we readily grant. <note n="h" place="margin">Vid Joh. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron oper. p. 361. f.</note> But his love of friendſhip, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſedneſſe with a ſinner, was not from everlaſting, but in time: as being a conſequent of the death of Chriſt, in whom he hath made us accepted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not only yield, but contend below, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. and ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 9. 25. I will call her beloved, who was not beloved:</hi> out of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 23. and as for the text which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> quotes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. I cannot divine to what end it is, unleſſe it be to finde me work: ſeeing the love there ſpoken of is manifeſtly temporal, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and the life mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. in the latter, is the flouriſhing and honourable condition unto which God had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both in reſpect of their Politick and Church-State, who were originally the feweſt and meaneſt of all people: and in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe, is the life which he breaths into ſinful ſoules. But what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116045:16"/> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would inferre from hence, himſelfe beſt knows. In ſhort, I readily grant that Gods eternal love doth concurre, <hi>ut cauſa uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalis prima,</hi> as the firſt univerſal cauſe, not only to our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in time, but to all other our ſpiritual bleſſings: but an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal cauſe produceth nothing without particulars: and the quality of the effect is not to be aſcribed to the univerſal, but to the particular cauſe. 2. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is proving, that Gods <hi>velle non punire,</hi> is that act, by which we are diſcharged and acquitted from ſin, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from wrath. I wiſh he had ſhewed me how this Concluſion iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues from theſe premiſſes. His Argument in forme muſt run thus. Gods eternal love diſcharges the Elect from ſin, and ſecures them from wrath. Gods <hi>velle non punire,</hi> is his eternal love. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> is already diſproved. The <hi>minor,</hi> if underſtood of the love of God in whole, confounds Election and Juſtification, (which yet Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is careful to diſtinguiſh a little below) for what is Gods Election, but his Love, or his <hi>velle dare bonum?</hi> If of the Love of God in part, the Argument will run thus. That which is part of Gods eternal love, is a ſinners diſcharge from ſin. Gods <hi>velle non punire,</hi> is part of his eternal love. <hi>Ergo.</hi> If the <hi>major</hi> be true, Gods purpoſe of giving Chriſt, of calling ſinners, of ſanctifying them, yea, of afflicting them, and of adminiſtring any Providence towards them, which in the iſſue proves for their good, may as well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Juſtification, as his <hi>velle non punire.</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath already granted (at leaſt <hi>verbo tenus</hi>) that, notwithſtanding the Will of God, not to puniſh the Elect, the Law muſt needs be ſatisfied for their ſins, no leſſe then for the ſins of others. If this be true, then the eternal act of Gods Election in it ſelfe conſidered, gives the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves no more ſecurity from wrath, then if they had not been elected. Surely, that conceſſion will never be reconciled with the doctrine here delivered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But we come on to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſecond proof, and that is from<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Scripture, <hi>Rom. 8. 33. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> The Propoſition is either an univerſal Negative, No E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſon can be juſtly charged with ſin: or an univerſal affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, All elect perſons are free from the charge of ſin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould have put in the Apoſtles anſwer to the Queſtion, and then he had prevented mine. The words are theſe, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth.</hi> Hence it follows, either negatively, that no elect perſon being juſtified, can be effectually charged with ſin: or affirmatively,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116045:17"/> that all the elect that are juſtified, are free from ſuch a charge: free (I ſay) not becauſe elect, but becauſe juſtified: for the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſin is manifeſtly oppoſed, not to their Election, but to their Juſtification: but that their Juſtification is their Election, or any part of it, or contemporary with it (as I may ſo ſpeak) is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, without any foundation in the text. 2. Yea, it cannot be inferred according to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> principles, though we ſhould grant the Election here ſpoken of, to be that which is from eternity, (of which preſently) for the Juſtification here ſpoken of, is that which is grounded in the death of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that died.</hi> But the eternal Juſtification, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is pleading for from the text, is not grounded in the death of Chriſt, (for it is an Act in God from eternity.) Now obſerve (<hi>Reader</hi>) that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies Chriſt to have merited the Act of Juſtification, but only the effects. I would know then, whether the Apoſtle ſpeak of the Act or effects of Juſtification in thoſe words, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> if of the Act, then the Elect were from eternity unchargeable: and whoſe charge then did Chriſt beare? and why doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> all along tell us, that our diſcharge from the curſe is the fruit of Chriſts merits? yea, and what more (as to the <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rminus à quo</hi> of our ſalvation) I ſay, what more could Chriſt merit poſſibly, then that we ſhould not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with ſin? And if that were done before by an eternal act, there will be no effects of Juſtification left for Chriſt to merit, as to our deliverance from ſin. But if the Juſtification here ſpoken of be meant, not of the act, but of the effects, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will grant me, without farther diſputing, that this place is inſufficient to prove, that Gods eternal purpoſe of not puniſhing is our Juſtification. 3. But I am out of doubt, that the Elect here, are not ſo called in reference to Election from eternity, but rather in reference to election tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, (as our <note n="l" place="margin">Dr Twiſſe. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26, 27, 28. James 2. 5. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 6. The reaſon is plain: becauſe ſuch Elect are here meant, who were the preſent objects of the worlds reproaches, injurious ſentences, falſe accuſations and ſlanders, &amp;c. for whoſe comfort, in this their ſuffering condition, the Apoſtle ſpeaks theſe words: to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, that all the malice and abuſes of the world ſhould do them

                  <p>WE have heard what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> can ſay for himſelf. Before I<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> go any farther, I ſhall ſet down a few Arguments to prove, that the eſſence of Juſtification doth not conſiſt in Gods eternal Will or Purpoſe of not puniſhing. And firſt, from the efficient cauſe. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is ſuch an act, whereof Jeſus Chriſt our Mediatour, as Lord and King, is the efficient cauſe with God the Father. (He is alſo the meriting cauſe as Prieſt, by the offering or ſacrifice of himſelf: But of this we ſpeak not now) <hi>Acts 5. 31. John 5. 19, 22, 26, 27. Luke</hi> 24. 47. and other places before quoted. But Jeſus Chriſt our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, as Lord and King, doth not will or purpoſe with God from eternity not to puniſh ſinners. The reaſon is plain: becauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all eternity was purpoſed of God to be Lord and King. <hi>Ergo</hi> Juſtification doth not conſiſt eſſentially in the Will or Purpoſe of God not to puniſh. 2. Juſtification is an act of God purpoſed. <hi>Ergo</hi> it cannot conſiſt in his purpoſe. The reaſon is, becauſe elſe God muſt purpoſe to purpoſe, which is inconvenient. The Antecedent is almoſt the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 3. 8. The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before, the Goſpel to</hi> Abraham We have ſcarce more evidence of any truth, upon which we lay the weight of our ſalvation, then this text affords us of the point in hand, ſaying, that God <hi>would juſtifie,</hi> in the future tenſe: making Juſtification the object of divine foreſight: affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to have been preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. 3. If there be no ſuch act in God (at leaſt that we may conceive of) as <hi>velle non punire, preciſely and formally,</hi> then our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification cannot conſiſt in that act: the reaſon is plaine, becauſe then our Juſtification were preciſely nothing. But there is no ſuch act in God that we may conceive of, as <hi>velle non punire</hi> preciſely
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116045:18"/> 
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi> For proof of the Aſſumption. (<hi>Reader</hi>) thou muſt remember that the foregoing Argument proves, that there was in God from eternity a will to juſtifie believers in time: that is; 1. To diſcharge them from the obligation of the Law: by which that puniſhment becomes legally undue, which before was legally due: and hence it follows, 2. That they are not puniſhed <hi>de facto,</hi> ſo that impunity ſimply is no part nor effect of Juſtification: but as following upon a legal diſobligation: otherwiſe every ſinner in the world that were not preſently puniſhed, were juſtified. The impunity of a ſinner ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it may be an effect or part of Juſtification, muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its <hi>modus,</hi> as the impunity of a perſon diſcharged from the obligation of the Law: for God doth ſo free us from puniſhment, as may be without the leaſt prejudice to the truth, or juſtice or authority of his Law. Accordingly I affirme, that God never purpoſed not to puniſh; <hi>preciſely, praeſcindendo à modo,</hi> as impunity is ſevered from the manner in which it is given: but he purpoſed not to puniſh <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do congruo,</hi> in a congruous way: by diſobliging, firſt from the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law, and thereby giving them a legal right not to be puniſhed: and not to let them go unpuniſhed, while the Law ſtands in full force againſt them. 1. That which was never executed, was never purpoſed. But never ſinner went unpuniſhed, while the Law ſtood in full force againſt him. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Propoſition is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable. In the Aſſumption Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will agree with me, for he contends that all the Elect were diſcharged from the Law, and had a right given them to impunity in the death of Chriſt, and no elect perſon ever had, or ſhall have impunity in any other way. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was never purpoſed that they ſhould have it in any other way: that is, that it was never purpoſed preciſely that they ſhould not be puniſhed. 2. Gods Purpoſe and his Laws will elſe be at enmity one with another: for if he purpoſe not to puniſh preciſely (<hi>praeſcindendo à modo</hi>) and yet do puniſh; then he croſſeth his purpoſe: and if he do, not puniſh, the Law being ſuppoſed to remain in full force, he is unfaithful, if not alſo unjuſt, as ſome <note n="k" place="margin">Dr. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis an expreſſion that neither God nor man will owne, ſo farre as I can finde. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> is known to reject it often, not without ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deteſtation. Condemnation is every where in Scripture made an act of juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. and 2. 2. <hi>Matth. 23. 33. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 3. and multitudes of other places.

                  <p>5. That which deſtroys not a ſinners obligation to puniſhment, is not his Juſtification. The reaſon is, becauſe Juſtification is <hi>cauſa c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpens obligationis ad poenam:</hi> a diſcharge and acquittance from ſin and condemnation, ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 33, 34. and 5. 8, 9. But Gods <hi>velle non punire</hi> deſtroys not a ſinners obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I thus prove. The obligation which this Will of God deſtroys, either is that which lies upon them from eternity, by ſome immanent act of God: (I ſpeak now in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Dialect: for to me 'tis very abſurd, to talke of an actual obligation upon a perſon not exiſting) but this will never be endured, that Gods immanent acts ſhould deſtroy one another, or elſe it is the temporal obligation which comes upon them by the Law: other obligation in time there is none. Now the foreſaid Will of God deſtroyes this legal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either from eternity, or in time. How it ſhould do it from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity I cannot imagine: becauſe neither the Law, nor the ſinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the obligation do exiſt from eternity: and what it is to deſtroy an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that is not, nor never was; upon a perſon that is not, nor never was; by a Law that is not, nor never was; is a myſtery beyond humane comprehenſion. If in time, I would know when? either as ſoon as the Law is made, or as ſoon as it is broken, or in ſome period of time after? Not as ſoon as the Law is made, for a ſinner is not obliged to puniſhment by the Law, till he hath broken the Law: and where there is no obligation, there can be no deſtruction thereof. If as ſoon as the Law is broken, I would know how? for if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the foreſaid Will and Purpoſe of God, the Law have power to oblige the ſinner to puniſhment; it hath power alſo to hold him under the ſame obligation; notwithſtanding the ſame purpoſe.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116045:19"/> If it can oblige him for a minute, then for two, then for ten, then for an houre, then for a yeare, then for ever, unleſſe there be ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act beſides the bare purpoſe of God, to abrogate or relaxe the Law. <hi>Cauſa eadem ſemper facit idem.</hi> Gods purpoſes make no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges immediately upon his Lawes, or any other external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>6. If there may be a will or purpoſe not to puniſh, where yet there<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> is no Juſtification or pardon, (for theſe two words are of the ſame importance in this debate) then Juſtification doth not conſiſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially in a purpoſe not to puniſh. But there may be a will not to puniſh, where there is no pardon. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Aſſumption is manifeſt. There may be hundreds of men at an Aſſizes: ſuppoſe they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, not to puniſh the Malefactors that are then and there to be tried. Are the ſaid malefactors therefore pardoned? No. Then there may be a will not to puniſh, which is no pardon. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is not eſſentially a will not to puniſh. <hi>Definitio reciprocatur cum definito.</hi> If it be ſaid, that pardon is not an act of the will, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power or faculty, but as the will of a man under ſome other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition or qualification, namely, as having <hi>jus ad poenam exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendam,</hi> a right to inflict puniſhment: which becauſe it is peculiar to the Judge, therefore his will not to puniſh is pardon, but not the will of the reſt that may be preſent in the Court: this is as much as I expect: for hence it follows (if the caſe be applied to God) that the name of Juſtification cannot be given to his eternal Will or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I will not meddle with the Queſtion, <hi>An Deus poſſit creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram immerentem affligere?</hi> But <hi>jus puniendi,</hi> a right of puniſhing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crews to none, whether God or man, but upon ſuppoſition of ſome offence committed. But from eternity there was no ſin. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the will or purpoſe of not puniſhing, was not <hi>voluntas habentis jus ad poenam infligendam. Ergo,</hi> it may not be called by the name of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. When I ſpeak of a right of puniſhing, which reſults from an offence committed, underſtand it not <hi>de jure poteſtatis,</hi> as if the ſaid offence gave any authority to God or man, which they had not before; but <hi>de jure exercitii:</hi> inaſmuch as that authority cannot be juſtly exerciſed in the puniſhment of a perſon, but upon ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed by him. 7. If notwithſtanding this <hi>velle non punire,</hi> God be bound in juſtice to puniſh the Elect for their ſins, unleſſe his juſtice be ſatisfied ſome other way, then his <hi>velle non punire</hi> is not their Juſtification. The reaſon is, 1. Becauſe Gods juſtice doth not binde him to puniſh thoſe whom he hath juſtified: but rather not to puniſh
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116045:19"/> them. 2. Becauſe his juſtice doth not binde him to puniſh another for their ſins, whom he already hath juſtified, (ſuppoſing their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to be as well in order of nature as of time, before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers puniſhment) But Gods juſtice bindes him to puniſh the elect for their ſin, unleſſe his juſtice be ſatisfied in ſome other way: as namely, by the death of Chriſt. This appears, becauſe <hi>de facto</hi> Chriſt bare that puniſhment which in juſtice was due to ſinners. <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>BEſides theſe Arguments, there be found more, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> objecteth againſt himſelfe, as diſproving his poſition, that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the Will or Purpoſe of God not to puniſh: which though they be not of my making, yet becauſe they are all very material for ſupport of the truth, I ſhall here undertake their defence.</p>
                  <p>The firſt objection then, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> propoſeth againſt his owne doctrine of eternal Juſtification is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it confounds Juſtification and Election.</p>
                  <p>His anſwer is. <q>That Election includes the end, and all the means: but Gods Will,</q> not to puniſh preciſely and formally, only ſome part of the meanes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> 1. Then the act of Juſtification is preciſely nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we have above demonſtrated. 2. And the effects of this act are like it ſelfe, juſt nothing; for never man was, nor ever ſhall be the better for this ſuppoſed Will of God preciſely, of not puniſhing; for if it produce us any good, it is either from eternity, or in time. Surely from eternity we are never the better for it: if in time, what is that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116045:20"/> good? I ſuppoſe, it will be ſaid, freedome from puniſhment. Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, doth it effect this freedome mediately, or immediately? medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it can do nothing: for it is determined preciſely to a non-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and containes not a preparation of any ſubordinate cauſe, for the effecting of our deliverance: Election indeed may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to our diſcharge, wrought by the death of Chriſt: becauſe it is a pre-ordination of Chriſt himſelf, and of all other more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſes, that work in their ſeveral orders and dependances for our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ality for the effecting of the ſaid freedome: of which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> aſſerts it to be the adequate and immediate cauſe in his next Propoſition. 3. To give a peculiar name to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of one part of the meanes, as diſtinct from the volition of all the reſt, unleſſe there be ſome ſpecial reaſon of ſuch denomination, is but to impoſe upon our underſtandings: for why may not Gods Will of ſending Chriſt, of publiſhing the Goſpel, of renewing our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of raiſing our bodies, of glorifying our whole man, each of them deſerve a more proper and ſignificant name, then Election, as well as his Will not to puniſh? for as to the act of this Will, <hi>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>do ſe habet circa omnia objecta volita,</hi> it reſpecteth all the meanes willed equally and in the ſame manner: the perſons to whom this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity is willed, lay under no other conſideration as the objects of this will, then as they are the objects of the will of calling, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, glorifying: ſo that neither from the act nor the object is there any reaſon of ſuch denomination. Indeed the objects (I mean, the <hi>media volita</hi>) of election and reprobation, being contraries in the utmoſt degree, and irreconcileable in the ſame perſon, our weak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings do therefore conceive of thoſe acts, as differing <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and accordingly we diverſifie their names. But the objects of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being amongſt themſelves conſentanies, and ſubordinate in their execution one to the other, and having no other entity or modality before their own exiſtence in time, then preciſely <hi>ut volita;</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together beyond the reach of my underſtanding, to imagine any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the volition of one meanes ſhould have a name proper to it ſelf, incommunicable to the volition of any other means, willed by the ſame act, &amp; to the ſame end. 4, But the anſwer yields as much as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſeeks: for it grants Juſtification to be part of election, namely, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio ad impunitatem.</hi> Whereas, 1. Scripture-Juſtification is a foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical act, ſay all our Proteſtants againſt the Papiſts. I ſpare quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe the thing is too well known to be denied. This cannot
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116045:20"/> be affirmed of Election. 2. The object of Election is neither a ſinner nor a righteous perſon preciſely, but one that is not: <hi>for we are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before the foundation of the world,</hi> Eph. 1. 4. before we have done good or evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. but the object of Scripture-Juſtification is a ſinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. whether believing or unbelieving, we diſpute below. 3. Election is not properly an act of mercy, but of abſolute dominion and liberty: Scripture-Juſtification is every where reported as an act of mercy, <hi>Pſal. 51. 1. Luke 1. 78, 79. Matth. 18. 33. Luke 18. 13, 14. Heb. 8. 12. Eph. 2. 4, 5. Ergo,</hi> Juſtification is not Election, nor any part of it. If it be ſaid, that the name of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Juſtification in theſe and other places, ſignifies not the act, but the effects; I ſhall refer to my vindication of the next objection, which is as followeth.</p>

                     <q>Firſt, (ſaith he) if Juſtification be taken for the thing willed, <hi>viz.</hi> the delivery of a ſinner from the curſe of the Law, then there is a great change made thereby: he that was a childe of wrath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hath peace and reconciliation with God But if we take it for the Will of God not to puniſh, then we ſay Juſtification doth not ſuppoſe any ſuch change: as if God had firſt a Will to puniſh his Elect, but afterwards he altered his Will, to a Will not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Plain dealing is beſt in a good cauſe. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had told me roundly, that the effects of Juſtification make a change in a perſons ſtate, but the act doth not; I had then known what I had to do. But I know not very well what to make of theſe lines. 1. The objection in forme is this. Juſtification imports a change in a perſons ſtate <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum.</hi> But <hi>velle nen punire,</hi> or any other eternal purpoſe of God, makes no ſuch change of a perſons ſtate. <hi>Ergo,</hi> To ſay now, that the Will of God not to puniſh ſuppoſeth no ſuch change, is to yield the Concluſion, that therefore it is not Juſtification. 2. What means he by a ſinners delivery from the curſe of the Law? either it.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116045:21"/> ſuppoſeth that a ſinner doth actually ſuffer the curſe of the Law, or ſome part of it, till Juſtification deliver him: but this he denieth of ſuch perſons for whom Chriſt hath ſatisfied (namely the Elect) <hi>page</hi> 60. 61. §. 2. or it ſuppoſeth an obligation of ſuch perſons by Law unto future puniſhment, till they be juſtified.

Nor can I tell in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe, what it is to have peace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. If he meane it of peace of conſcience, through the ſenſe of reconciliation, himſelfe will deny that that is the immediate effect of our delivery from the curſe: for faith apprehending recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation doth intervene, and that as a true proper cauſe of ſuch a peace. If he mean it of a ſtate of peace and reconciliation before God, he ſhould not need to aſcribe that to the thing willed: ſeeing the erernal Will of God is moſt ſufficient unto that (according to him) as being a real diſcharge from condemnation: an actual and compleat non-imputation of ſin; and he layes it down for an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, <hi>That the Elect were in Covenant with God before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world,</hi> page 170, 171. 4. The great change which he ſpeaks of, made by this delivery from the curſe of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That he that was a childe of wrath by nature, hath peace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, this great change, I ſay, is a huge nothing: for (ſaith he a little below) to be juſt and unjuſt is not properly a different ſtate before God, but a different conſideration of one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Elect themſelves then, even when believers, are children of wrath by nature, yea, of the Saints in glory, conſidered according to what they are by nature, it may be ſaid, that they are children of wrath. And is not that a great change, from wrath to reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which leaves a man every whit as much a childe of wrath as he was before? 5. I beleeve (with Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) that the Will or Purpoſe of God makes no change in a perſons ſtate: but I wonder what he meanes by the reaſon added. As if (ſaith he) God had firſt a Will to puniſh his Elect, but afterwards he altered his Will to a Will not to puniſh them.] As if God could not will a mutation in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without a mutation in his own Will. He made the world by his Will, and he alſo wills the diſſolution of it, after ſuch a period of time: this is a mutation in the world, but none in God. In like manner, he may will that the elect for a time ſhall ſtand obliged by Law, to the ſuffering of condemnation: and yet alſo will, that after a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116045:21"/> time this obligation ſhall ceaſe, and all this without any change in his will. But we ſhall prove hereafter, that is not the Will of Gods purpoſe, but his declared Lawes by which a ſinner is conſtituted juſt or unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to a more cloſe encounter. Juſtification (ſaith the<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> objection) imports a change of a perſons ſtate <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum.</hi> And if Scriptures be intelligible by the ſons of men, it cannot be denied, <hi>Rom. 5. 8, 9. While we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us: much more then, being now juſtified in his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> Whether we are juſtified by the blood of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, or through faith, we reſerve to be debated in its proper place; for the preſent it ſufficeth us to obſerve from hence, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification makes a change in a perſons ſtate <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu forenſi.</hi> And what can mans reaſon require more for proof of it, then theſe words afford? Had the Apoſtle ſaid, You were ſometimes cold, but now you are hot: you were ſometimes ſervants, but now you are free: you were ſometimes enemies, but now you are friends: he would ſcarcely be accounted a reaſonable creature, that ſhould deny ſuch expreſſions, to import a mutation from one terme to another. And muſt not then the like change be ſignified, when he ſaith, <hi>You were ſometime ſinners, but now you are juſtified?</hi> eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (which I perceiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And they of all men that maintain Juſtification to be perfect in the death of Chriſt, may not ſo underſtand the word <hi>ſinners</hi> in this place.

                     <hi>being now juſtified;</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks not of the act, but of the effects of Juſtification; <hi>I reply,</hi> 1. It is not lawful for man to teach the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to ſpeak. The Apoſtle tells us, that God commendeth his love towards us, in giving Chriſt to die for us while we were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that we might be juſtified in his blood, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. therefore that which in God is the cauſe of our Juſtification, in the blood of Chriſt, is his love, and ſo to be called. 2. If yet it ſhall be ſaid, that that love of God is our Juſtification; then whereas it is ſaid, <hi>God ſo loved us, as to juſtifie us in the blood of his Sonne;</hi> it muſt be ſaid henceforward, God ſo juſtified us, as to juſtifie us in the blood of his Sonne, which is ridiculous. 3. If temporal Juſtification in the blood of Chriſt, be but the effect of a former Juſtification which was from eternity; what an empty noiſe hath the Apoſtle made, in amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the love of God, in giving Chriſt to die for the Juſtification of ſinners and enemies? whoſoever is juſtified is not a ſinner, (in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſenſe of that word) but righteous: not an enemie, but recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled. 4. The Apoſtle (if his judgement may be taken) doth thus diſtinguiſh the act and the effects of Juſtification: that the act is that, by which of ſinners we are made juſt: the effect which follows upon it is; that we ſhall therefore be ſaved from wrath. It ſeemes, the diſtinction between the <hi>velle</hi> and the <hi>res volita</hi> in the matter of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116045:22"/> Juſtification was unknown to him. 5. And his diſcourſe ſuppoſeth, that the love and grace of God is nothing ſo much commended by giving the effects, as by putting forth the act of Juſtification: for herein God commends his love towards us, that while we were yet ſinners, he gave his Son to death for our Juſtification: and then (as a leſſer matter) he infers, much more being now juſtified we ſhall be ſaved from wrath. So alſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Now if by Juſtification in Chriſts blood be meant the effects, and not the act of Juſtification; then the love and grace of God is nothing near ſo great in juſtifying us through the blood of Chriſt, as in juſtifying us before without his blood. But this is moſt notoriouſly falſe; as is manifeſt, not from this text only, but from all the Scriptures, which proclaim that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juſtification, which we have through the blood of Chriſt, to be an act of greateſt love, and richeſt grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. and 5. 20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6; 7. and 2. 4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 14. Tit.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 6. The effects of Juſtification follow upon the act by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity, and without impediment. <hi>Ergo;</hi> the Juſtification here ſpoken of, is not the effect preciſely, but the act. The reaſon of the conſequence is, becauſe the Juſtification mentioned in the text, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not upon any ſimple precedent act of Juſtification, but is ſet forth as an act of ſuch moral difficulty, that it required no leſſe then the precious blood of the Son of God, to remove the obſtructions and hindrances of its exiſtence, and to make it to exiſt. The Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is proved from his manner of arguing <hi>à majori ad minus:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now juſtified, much more ſhall we be ſaved: implying that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion follows, as it were, neceſſarily, upon the poſition of the act of Juſtification. Yea, and I appeal to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelfe, or any man elſe, whether that act be not unworthy of the many glorious titles and epithets, which are every where in Scripture put upon Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently unworthy of that name: which being put <hi>in actu completo,</hi> can yet produce no good effect to a ſinner, nor ſet him one degree farther from wrath then he was before, unleſſe ſome other more ſufficient cauſe do interpoſe to midwiſe out its effects. This mindes me of another Argument, and that is this. 7. Juſtification is not an act of grace ſimply, but of powerful grace, or of grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing againſt the power of ſin: for this is that which creates the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and ſo commends the excellency of the grace of Juſtification, that it is the Juſtification of ſinners. Were it the Juſtification of ſuch as had never ſinned, but had been perfectly righteous, there were no ſuch difficulty in that. And therefore in the following part of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116045:23"/> Chapter, the Apoſtle expreſly declares the quality of this grace in juſtifying us, in that it <hi>abounds,</hi> and is powerful to juſtifie, above the ability of ſin to condemn, <hi>ver. 15, 17, 20, Ergo</hi> the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here ſpoken of, is the very act of Juſtification, or there is no ſuch thing at all: for if we place it in a ſimple eternal volition, there could be no moral difficulty in that, (no more then in the will of creating the world,) becauſe from eternity there could be no oppoſition or hindrance, for an act of grace to overcome. 8. The Juſtification me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by Chriſt, is not the effect, but the act. The reaſon we ſhall ſhew anon, becauſe it is abſurd to make Chriſt the meritour of the effects, when the act is in being before his merit. But the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here ſpoken of is that which is merited by Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I might alſo argue out of the following part of the Chapter, from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between Juſtification, and the act of condemnation, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon all men, by vertue of the firſt tranſgreſſion: (and therefore ſure cannot conſiſt in any eternal act of Gods will) and from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod there uſed in comparing <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, and of our parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king firſt in the image of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> in ſin and the effects thereof, before we be conformed to the image of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the effects thereof: but theſe Arguments out of the text it ſelf ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>Other Scriptures alſo there are in abundance which teſtifie, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> doth make a change in a perſons ſtate, <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum.</hi> As <hi>Col. 2. 13. You being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes.</hi> To be dead in ſins in this place, is clearly to be dead in Law, that is, to be obliged by Law to the ſuffering of death for ſin; for it is oppoſed to that life which conſiſts in remiſſion of ſin or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; ſo 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are juſtified:</hi> of which place more hereafter. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. and 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. And indeed all the places of Scripture which ſpeak of Gods juſtifying ſinners. If there be found out a new Juſtification which the Scriptures are not acquainted with, may they have joy of it that have diſcovered it. But I haſten to the ſecond part of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The change of a perſons ſtate <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum,</hi> ariſeth from the Law, and the conſideration of man in reference thereunto: by whoſe ſentence the tranſgreſſour is unjuſt: but being conſidered at the Tribunal of grace, and cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, he is juſt and righteous: which is not properly a different
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116045:23"/> ſtate before God, but a different conſideration of one and the ſame perſon. God may be ſaid at the ſame time to look upon a perſon, both as ſinful and as righteous: as ſinful in reference to his ſtate by nature, and as righteous in reference to his ſtate by grace. Now this change being but imputed, not inherent, it ſuppoſeth not the being of the creature, much leſſe any inherent difference, &amp;c.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe words are myſteries to me, and I confeſſe have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> me more perplexity and vexation of thoughts, then all the book beſides. Before I can give any anſwer to them, I muſt make ſome enquiry into the meaning of them. And for avoiding of confuſion in the words <hi>juſt and unjuſt,</hi> their importance in this place is no more, then to have or be without a right to ſalvation and life. Now to be unjuſt by nature, or in our ſelves, may be underſtood in a threefold ſenſe. 1. Poſitively, and then the meaning is, that for the ſin of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or for mens ſinfulneſſe in themſelves, they ſtand obliged before God, to the ſuffering of eternal puniſhment. This is ſo far from being Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> meaning, that I ſuppoſe it is the very thing which he intends to deny by theſe obſcure expreſſions: as he alſo often doth in other parts of this book: for it is impoſſible that a man ſhould ſtand before God, obliged to puniſhment, and diſobliged at the ſame time. 2. Or purely negatively, as denying nature to be the cauſe of our Juſtification. But neither do I think this to be Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the ſenſe will be ſo pitifully jejune: for thus to be juſt by grace, and unjuſt by nature is no more, then that it is grace and not nature which juſtifies us: and he that ſayes a man is juſtified by grace, and not by a piece of bread and butter, or by the flying of the clouds over his head, ſpeaks every whit as much to purpoſe. 3. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutively, <hi>in ſenſu diviſo &amp; ſecundum quid:</hi> that if we ſuppoſe there were no act of grace to hinder, men muſt needs be condemned: there being in themſelves ſufficient cauſe of condemnation, and in the Law ſufficient power to oblige them to it: but the grace of God doth hinder both the one and the other from coming forth into act, ſo that they never ſtand actually obliged to the ſuffering of puniſhment, notwithſtanding their own ſinfulneſſe, and the Lawes rigour. This if any thing, muſt be our Authours meaning, as beſt ſuiting with what he ſayes here and elſewhere, as <hi>page</hi> 111. §. 5. <q>By nature or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their ſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the Elect were children of wrath, they could expect nothing but wrath from God. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, beleevers conſidered in themſelves, and as they come from the loines of <hi>Adam,</hi> are ſinful and curſed creatures. And again,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116045:24"/> 
                        <hi>page</hi> 113. §. 7. The Law ſhews not who are condemned of God, but who are guilty and damnable in themſelves, if God ſhould deal with them by the Law.</q> Let us ſee then what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would have: this I think it is. That there is in all men, even the Elect themſelves, ſufficient cauſe of condemnation: that is, ſufficient cauſe on their part, why they ſhould loſe all right to ſalvation and life; and be actually damned: and alſo that there is nothing wanting in the nature and conſtitution of the Law, which is required in a Law, to make it able to binde or oblige men (even the Elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) unto puniſhment. And all this is true queſtionleſſe. But it is withal affirmed, that the Elect, by the gracious and eternal act of Gods Will, are abſolutely juſt before God: and by the ſame Will is the Law (though broken by them) diſabled from binding them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto puniſhment. So that they are ſaid to be unjuſt by the Law, or in themſelves, or by nature, not that they are at any time abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unjuſt, or without all right to life (for they are ſuppoſed to be abſolutely juſt from eternity) but as it were materially, becauſe if the foreſaid act of Gods Will had not prevented, they had been unjuſt ſimply and abſolutely.</p>
                  <p>Againſt which doctrine I have ſeveral things to oppoſe. 1. In<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> general, whereas the intent of it is to prove that a ſinner may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and unjuſtified both at once, it is manifeſt that theſe words are uſed in ſome other ſenſe, then what the Scriptures are wont to take them in: becauſe to be a ſinner and to be righteous, to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and to be condemned, to have ones ſins retained and remitted according to Scripture are contraries, and never agree to the ſame perſon at the ſame time, <hi>John 3. 17, 18. Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 33, 34. and 5. 8, 9. <hi>John 20. 23. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 11. and many other places. 2. If an elect ſinner be never unjuſt, but in this reſpective, diminutive ſenſe, then it is impoſſible for the act or effects of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to make any change upon him: becauſe it is impoſſible but that he who is juſtified meerly of grace, ſhould be unjuſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: even glorified Saints are to all eternity unjuſt by nature, or of themſelves, or in reference to their ſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. If this be the whole of a ſinners unrighteouſneſſe, then by the Law of nature ſinners are not unjuſt ſimply and univerſally, ſo as to have no right at all to life: but only in ſome reſpect, ſo as to have no right by that Law which they have tranſgreſſed. But all ſinners are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally unjuſt by the Law of nature, which I thus prove. 1. If <hi>Adam,</hi> while he continued obedient, had by his obedience a right to life, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116045:24"/> had no right at all, but by his obedience according to the Law, then upon his diſobedience he became univerſally unjuſt by the ſame Law. The reaſon's plain, becauſe if there be but one rule of righteouſneſs in being, then he that is not righteous by that rule, is not righteous at all. <hi>Sublat â cauſà totali, tollitur effectus totaliter.</hi> But <hi>Adam</hi> whiles he continued obedient, had by his obedience and by the Law a right to life, and had no right at all, but by his obedience. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is thus confirmed. If <hi>Adam</hi> had any other right then by the Law, then it muſt be by ſome grace of God. But this cannot be according to Scripture: becauſe to have a right by grace and works too, is inconſiſtent according to Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. If by grace, then not of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace. If by works, then not of grace, otherwiſe work is no more work. How long <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> continued innocent, I cannot tell. If but half a day; if but half an houre, it is all one to my purpoſe: it being concluded by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> one or both, were ſaved, and therefore were elect: and <hi>Adams</hi> caſe was then the caſe of all men, one as well as another, he being as it were the epitome of all mankinde in what he did, and in what befell him. 2.

                     <hi>ſeparate from Chriſt, ſtrangers from the Covenant of Promiſe, and without hope, Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12. till by the faith of that Goſpel which the Apoſtles preached, <hi>ver. 20. they ceaſed to be any more ſtrangers and forreigners, and became fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God,</hi> ver. 19. Had the Apoſtle ſpoke theſe words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reprobate Gentiles, I am perſwaded it would never have come into any mans minde, (no, not Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> himſelfe) to deny, but that they did ſignifie thoſe Gentiles, to be without all right to life and ſalvation, and other priviledges, immunities and dignities, given by the great Charter of the Goſpel, to the City and Family of God. But the Apoſtle doth here deſcribe the miſeries of a Gentile ſtate, and therefore of every one that was a Gentile: for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is equally the ſame, till they turne Chriſtians. <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe Gentiles that now beleeved, were yet ſometimes without all right to life, that is, they were univerſally unrighteous or unjuſt: and that by the Law of nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>4. If the Elect were never ſimply and abſolutely unjuſt, then Chriſt is not their Saviour. But Chriſt is moſt ſurely the Saviour of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The reaſon of the Propoſition is, becauſe if Chriſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116045:25"/> a Saviour, then he ſaves either from that wrath which they do actually ſuffer, (which neither Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will grant, nor my ſelfe without limitation) or from an actual obligation to the ſuffering of wrath when the time is come: and this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies. But tell me then how is Chriſt called a Saviour? ſeeing none can be properly ſaved, but ſuch as are ſubject to periſhing, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued righteous, he might well have propagated <hi>life</hi> to his children, but not <hi>ſalvation,</hi> becauſe they had never been in danger of death. And he that is ſimply and abſolutely juſt, though in ſome reſpect unjuſt, is not in danger of periſhing, and therefore not capable of being ſaved. If it be ſaid that Chriſt ſaves us from wrath, becauſe we ſhould have been obliged to wrath, if ſome act of grace in God had not prevented, there being matter enough in us, for which we ſhould have forfeited our right to life. The anſwer is, 1. Let that act then which prevents our obligation, be called our Saviour, and not Chriſt. 2. And let the thing it ſelfe be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuppoſing the Elect do now at no time ſtand obliged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to puniſhment, for any or all their ſins: that yet they ſhould have been ſo obliged, if Gods purpoſe had not hindred, that is, ſuppoſing the Law hath now no effect upon their perſons, as to the binding of them under wrath for ſin, that yet it ſhould have had, if the foreſaid purpoſe had not prevented. I deny it: and if it be true, yet I conceive it impoſſible for man to prove it. But we muſt of neceſſity ſpeak ſomething more of theſe matters in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, and therefore here I ſuperſede any farther argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore a little farther demurre upon Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> words, as<note place="margin">§ 21.</note> he here preſents them to us, and I paſſe on to the next Argument. 1. Whereas he ſaith, that the change <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum</hi> ariſeth from the different conſideration of a perſon, he may be pleaſed to conſider, that conſiderations make no changes. Things are to be conſidered as they are, and not by conſideration made what they are not. Our underſtanding will conceive of a man as cloathed with, or abſtracted from all moral qualifications: and ſo conſider him ſometimes as juſt and not unjuſt: ſometimes as unjuſt, and not juſt: ſometimes as neither juſt nor unjuſt. But to conſider an unjuſt man as he is juſt, or a juſt man as he is unjuſt, is to conſider a man as he is a horſe. <hi>Obj.</hi> A man is not a horſe, therefore I cannot ſo conſider him. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No more is a juſtified man unjuſt, nor an unjuſtified man juſt before God. <hi>Obj.</hi> Yes that he is, for he may be unjuſt by nature,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116045:25"/> and yet juſtified of grace at the ſame time. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True. But then obſerve (<hi>Reader</hi>) that to be unjuſt by nature in this ſenſe, is <hi>terminus diminuens:</hi> and ſo to conſider a man as unjuſt by nature, is not to conſider him as unjuſt ſimply; becauſe to be unjuſt by nature, is not to be unjuſt ſimply (for a man is ſuppoſed to be juſt by grace at the ſame time) therefore when it is argued, a man may be unjuſt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and juſt by grace at the ſame time; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he may be juſt and unjuſt at the ſame time: I deny the conſequence. He that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, may (if he will) conſider the ſame man as juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and unjuſt before man: and according to the variety of humane Law, multiply the notions of injuſtice, and ſay he is unjuſt by the Engliſh Law, but not by the Romane Law: or by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law, but not by the Grecian Law, &amp;c. and when all this is done, he may ſay he hath proved, that a man is juſt and unjuſt at the ſame time before God: but I will not believe him. 2. And as it is contrary to reaſon, ſo to the manner of ſpeech in Scripture (as was noted before) <hi>Rom. 5. 8, 9. we were ſinners, but now we are juſtified.</hi> He doth not ſay, we <hi>are</hi> ſinners, but <hi>are</hi> or <hi>were</hi> juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 11. You were unrighteous, but now you are juſtified.</hi> Muſt we read it thus, you <hi>are</hi> unrighteous, but you <hi>were</hi> or <hi>are</hi> juſtified? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. you <hi>were</hi> the children of wrath. He doth not ſay you <hi>are</hi> the children of wrath, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. You <hi>were</hi> alienated, but now are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. In all which places we finde a ſtate of righteouſneſſe, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a ſtate of unrighteouſneſſe: but of being righteous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous at the ſame time, we have no mention. 3. And what is it to <hi>conſider</hi> a man as juſt or unjuſt? either it is a meer ſpeculative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, apprehending in a man <hi>rationem juſti,</hi> without apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>rationem injuſti,</hi> or <hi>è contra:</hi> but how unreaſonably is it ſaid, that the change of a perſons ſtate <hi>ab injuſto ad juſtum,</hi> ariſeth from ſuch a conſideration as this is, which is as compatible to man as unto God, and altogether extrinſecal and accidental to a mans being juſt or unjuſt: or elſe it is a practical, judicial conſideration, in order to Gods dealing with a man as juſt and unjuſt: but ſurely Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will abhorre (as well he may) that God ſhould intend to deal with his Elect as unjuſt. 4. And to what he ſpeaks of an imputed change, 'tis an expreſſion I never heard before. I have read of an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe, which makes a real change (real I mean, not as oppoſed to moral or relative, but to mental or notional) but an imputed change is a meer fiction, and good for nothing as I know, but to give juſt ground to the Papiſts, to reproach us with a putative
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116045:26"/> righteouſneſſe, as they call it in a jeer. But there be no fictions in God at all: and by how much the more they are found in men, by ſo much the more phantaſtical we account them, (unleſſe they be rhetorical fictions uſed for doctrine, or illuſtration, or the like.) 5. And much like all the reſt it is, that he ſaith to be juſt and unjuſt is not a different ſtate: whereas himſelf ſo calls it but juſt before; and immediately after tells us, that men are accounted juſt in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their ſtate by grace, and unjuſt in reference to their ſtate by nature. Is a ſtate of nature then, and a ſtate of grace different ſtates? if they be not, why doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> call them ſo? if they be, then a ſtate of nature is a ſtate of unrighteouſneſſe, and a ſtate of grace is a ſtate of righteouſneſſe: and ſo to be righteous and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is a different ſtate: or elſe there is no man in the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous before God, or the unrighteous are in as good a ſtate as the righteous. But I will puzzle my ſelfe no longer with theſe ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oracles.</p>

                  <p>THe third objection ſucceeds, and that is this. If juſtification be<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> an immanent act in God, it is antecedent, not only to faith, but to the merits of Chriſt: which is contrary to many Scriptures, that do aſcribe our Juſtification unto his blood, as the meritorious cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That although Gods Will not to puniſh, be antecedent to the death of Chriſt, yet for all we may be ſaid to be juſtified in him, becauſe the whole effect of that Will, is by and for the ſake of Chriſt. As though electing love precede the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. yet are we ſaid to be choſen in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. becauſe all the effects of that love, are given by, and through, and for him.</q>

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again I muſt complain of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> mincing. Had he ſaid, the Act of Juſtification goes before the death of Chriſt, but the effects follow, he had ſpoken plainly. But when we are diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that Gods Will is not our Juſtification, becauſe our Juſtification according to Scripture is a fruit of Chriſts merit, which an immanent act of Gods Will cannot be: to tell us now, that indeed Gods Will is antecedent to Chriſts merits, is to yield the Argument, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116045:26"/> it is not our Juſtification: for nothing more certain from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then that our Juſtification is the fruit of the merits and blood of Chriſt; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. and 5. 8, 9. and 4. 25. and 8. 3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19, 21. Gal. 3. 13, 14. Eph. 1. 7. Col. 2. 13, 14. Heb.</hi> 9. 12, 22. and 10. 14, 18. and ſundry other places. 2. It is alſo unworthy of the precious blood of the Sonne of God, to aſcribe no more to it, then that it merits the effects of our Juſtification: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a farre leſſe matter to purchaſe the effects, then to purchaſe the act which is the cauſe of them: as I have before obſerved from the Apoſtles manner of arguing, <hi>Rom. 5. If while we were ſinners Chriſt died for us, much more then being now juſtified, ſhall we be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from wrath.</hi> 3. It is alſo no little undervaluing of the glorious bleſſing of Juſtification, to ſuppoſe it ſo impotent, as that it cannot produce its own effects, nor do the ſinner any good at all unleſſe the Son of God interpoſe by his death to make it effectual. I deſire to ſpeak of ſpiritual things with feare and trembling: But I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſay, ſuch a Juſtification as this is not worth grammercy. If it be objected, that I may ſay as much of Gods electing love, for neither doth that produce its effects without the death of Chriſt: I anſwer, no ſuch matter, for the death of Chriſt it ſelfe, and all other particular cauſes of our ſalvation, are the effects of election, which it ſelfe produceth in their reſpective ſubordinations. But Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a particular cauſe, determined preciſely to a non-punition, which yet it cannot effect. Nor doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf make the death of Chriſt an effect of Juſtification, and if he did, he muſt reade the Scriptures backward, but of this more by and by. 4. I deny, that the effects of Juſtification can be merited without the act; for this eternal Juſtification (according to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> theologie) is an actual and real diſcharge from all ſin and condemnation: a compleat non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of ſin and imputation of righteouſneſſe. Therefore it is impoſſible, but that by this act the Elect muſt have a right given them to deliverance from wrath: which is ſo evident, that himſelfe contendeth, that the Elect (even whiles they are in actual rebellion againſt God) have a right to ſalvation, grounded in the Purpoſe of God, <hi>page</hi> 122. And what then did Chriſt merit for them? Not a right to deliverance from wrath, for that they have already: and <note n="o" place="margin">

Nor yet doth Chriſt merit the continuance of this right: for it is impoſſible it ſhould be forfeited, for a man can forfeit nothing with God but by ſin: and ſin, if it be pardoned, (as here it is ſuppoſed to be, even all ſins, and that from eternity) hath no ſtrength to work ſuch a forfeiture, no more then if it never had been committed.

Wherefore, the effects of Juſtification, being inſeparable from the act, Chriſt merited the act as well as the effect, or elſe he merited neither.</p>
                  <p>The compariſon brought in for illuſtration makes the matter worſe<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> then it was before. For, 1. It is utterly falſe, that all the effects of Gods electing love, are given for the merits of Chriſt: for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt to death is an effect of Gods electing love; and yet Chriſt did not merit his own ſending into the world. 2. That the parallel may conſiſt, it muſt be firſt ſuppoſed that the intention of particular meanes have particular names, as ſo many particular acts or cauſes, and then determined that Chriſt merited not thoſe acts, but their effects; As for example, That Gods intention to make us his children, is our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adoption, and Chriſt merited not our Adoption, but the effects thereof. His intention to ſanctifie us is our ſanctification; and Chriſt merited not our ſanctification, but the effects of it. His intention to glorifie us is our glorification, and Chriſt merits its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: even as his intent to pardon us is our Juſtification: and Chriſt doth afterward merit the effects, but not the act. Thus muſt the compariſon run, or it leaves the matter darker then it found it. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not allow of this, let him acknowledge his doctrine to be without parallel. 3. The effects of Chriſts merits are alſo the effects of Gods electing love: becauſe the merits of Chriſt themſelves, are the effects of the ſame love: and the cauſe of the cauſe is alſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116045:27"/> the cauſe of the thing cauſed. But if our Lords death had been only from his own will, not pre-ordained of God in the decree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; all the benefits purchaſed by it, muſt have been aſcribed to it as the firſt cauſe; and Gods Will of beſtowing them had not been cauſal, but meerly concomitant or conſequent. Now his will not to puniſh, containes not a preparation of any ſubordinate cauſe, for the effecting of this impunity. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Chriſt merited it, it muſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him as the principal and only cauſe, and not to Gods Will of not puniſhing, becauſe that Will of God is not the cauſe of the merits of Chriſt, as being determined preciſely to a non-punition. And ſo there will be the effects of Juſtification without an act: or the act of Juſtification produceth its own effects but by accident; or rather doth not produce them at all, but ſtands by without efficacy, whiles another cauſe doth the work. Therefore herein alſo the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon halts.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt objection which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> makes againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> is this: We may as well call Gods Will to create, Creation; and his Will to call, Calling; and to glorifie, Glorification; as his Will to juſtifie, Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>His anſwer is, Creating, calling, and glorifying import an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent change in the perſon created, called, glorified, which forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not, it being perfect and compleat in the minde of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. The anſwer contradicts it ſelfe; for it yields it to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech, to ſay, that God doth will or purpoſe to juſtifie: (even as proper, as to ſay, he doth will or purpoſe to create, to call, to glorifie) and yet beares us in hand, that Juſtification is perfect and compleat in the minde of God. Whatſoever is purpoſed is future. If it have already an actual exiſtence, it is not capable of being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to exiſt. But the immanent acts of Gods minde are not fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from eternity. 2. Though Juſtification do not make an inherent change, yet it makes an adherent change, (as was largely proved from Scripture but now) even as if a Malefactour be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards pardoned: his condemnation and pardon make an adherent change, that is, a relative: though he remain the ſame man that he was, and be not changed inherently and really. And I wonder, why the purpoſe of an act which makes an adherent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative change, ſhould be called by the name of that act: rather then the purpoſe of ſuch an act, which makes an inherent real change, ſhould be called by its name. <hi>Ars poſterior utitur prioris oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116045:28"/> ſuppoſeth nature. 3. It is true, that Creation, &amp;c. do make an inherent change. But the queſtion is, whether we have not as much ground from Scripture to underſtand thoſe words, as ſignifying not the act, but the effect of Creation, &amp;c. as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the word Juſtification in Scripture, for the effects, not for the act. Suppoſe a man ſhould be ſo void of ſobriety, as to ſay, the words, Creation, Vocation, Glorification, and what of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſignifie not thoſe ſeveral acts, but their effects; what could Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſay againſt it? To ſay, Creation, &amp;c. makes an inherent change, is to ſay nothing: for it will quickly be anſwered, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Creation, Vocation, &amp;c. do make an inherent change, not the acts. If he tell me, the words are never uſed in Scripture, but as importing ſuch a change; I anſwer ſtill as he doth of Juſtification, that the words, where-ever they are to be found in Scripture, are to be underſtood of the effects, not of the act. If he yet ſay, that it is contrary to all our Proteſtant Divines, I ſay ſo too. <hi>Et nomine muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to narratur fabula de te.</hi> Thus much for the vindication of the foure objections, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> propoſeth againſt himſelfe.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the begging of the queſtion be the ending of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, we have done. It is here ſuppoſed, that the aforeſaid Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God is the imputation of righteouſneſſe, and the non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin: which ſhould have been proved, and not begged. And therefore the foundation failing, there needs no more to be done to demoliſh the ſuperſtructure; yet a word or two of that alſo: 2. I ſay therefore, that an eternal, actual, <hi>privative</hi> non-imputation of future ſin, is either non-ſenſe, or a contradiction, (let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> take his choice, and conſider withal, what he is like to make of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at laſt) for that which is only future, can be deprived of nothing but its futurity: and if it be <hi>ab aeter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e one moment wherein it is made future, and another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein it is made non-future: which cannot be, becauſe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity there is neither <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>poſterius.</hi> Now this privative non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of future ſin, what doth it <hi>privare?</hi> Not the futurity of ſin: for then there never was nor ſhall be any ſuch thing as ſin in the world: for nothing exiſts in time, which before its exiſtence was not future. That then which this non-imputation is privative of, muſt be the imputation of ſin to a perſon, <hi>cui debitum eſt imputari.</hi> (for that is the habit which only is contrary to it): for as the privative non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of ſin preſent, and in actual being is privative only <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putationis nunc debitae;</hi> ſo the like non-imputation of ſin future, is privative only <hi>imputationis futurae debitae.</hi> The Argument therefore returnes: for if this imputation be <hi>ab aeterno non-futura,</hi> then is it <hi>ab aeterno</hi> undeprivable of its futurity: for nothing but that which is future can be deprived of its futurity: and if it be future <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> then it cannot be made <hi>ab aeterno</hi> non-future: for to be future and non-future <hi>ab aeterno</hi> is a contradiction. 3. But if Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> by his privative non-imputation, mean no more then a poſitive act, by which that puniſhment is kept off, which is, or will become due to a ſinner, I anſwer farther. That the very eſſence of the pardon of ſin, conſiſts in making that puniſhment undue which before was due, and conſequently, in freeing the ſinner from all actual ſuffering for ſin, (for the remiſſion of ſin is oppoſed to the retaining of it, <hi>John</hi> 20. 23.) or elſe in preventing, that that puniſhment ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116045:29"/> due, which otherwiſe would be due. If in the former ſenſe ſin be pardoned from eternity, (for non-imputation and pardon are all one, both in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe, and of the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 7, 8.) then cannot puniſhment become due in time: but it is from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>non futurum debitum,</hi> even as the pardon of ſin preſent and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally committed, makes that puniſhment remaines no longer due to a perſon, which till then was due. And if it be from eternity a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futurum debitum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> then neither can it be pardoned from eternity, (pardon being eſſentially a diſcharge from puniſhment, due actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in futurition) nor if it could, can that pardon be an act of grace: becauſe it is no grace to pardon him, who neither is, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will or can be puniſhable. Yet here, Reader, diſtinguiſh of the dueneſſe of puniſhment: which may ariſe, either from the nature of ſin in it ſelf: and in this ſenſe it is impoſſible that ſin ſhould be pardoned, either from eternity or in time; becauſe it is impoſſible, but that ſin ſhould be in it ſelfe puniſhable, or worthy of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: even as on the contrary, vertue is in it ſelf eſſentially laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or rewardable: Or it may be the act of God by his Law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king puniſhment due to the ſinner, or obliging the ſinner unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for his ſin, and in this ſenſe only is it pardonable: and if it be actually pardoned from eternity, then is puniſhment made from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity <hi>non debita,</hi> which, as I ſaid before, deſtroys both the ſubſtance and grace of pardon: let us ſee if we can clear it by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. <hi>This Will of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is like the will of a man, not to require that debt, that ſhall, or is about to be contracted.</hi> Come on then. <hi>Titius</hi> knows, that <hi>Caius</hi> will be indebted to him: and his purpoſe is before-hand not to require this debt. I ask, Is this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the pardon of the debt or no? if not, the cauſe is yielded; if it be, we will ſuppoſe that <hi>Titius</hi> makes this purpoſe within himſelf in the moment A: the debt will be contracted in the moment C. All the ſpace of time that is between A and C, the debt is not actually a debt, but only future. If then this future debt be forgiven in the moment A, then from thenceforth it ceaſeth to be future, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt in the moment C, becauſe for a debt to be forgiven, is to be made no debt: if it be forgiven at preſent, it is none at preſent; if it be forgiven for the future, it is not in futurition to be a debt. 4. I will only adde this. That according to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, puniſhment doth never become due to the Elect, ſo as that they ſtand obliged before God, to ſuffer for any of their ſins: for that which in the protaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of the ſimilitude, is a debt between man and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116045:29"/> man, is a ſinners obligation to puniſhment in the reddition. Now Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies, that an elect ſinner is at any time unjuſt ſimply and abſolutely, but only in a diminutive ſenſe: that is unjuſt by nature, or of himſelf (but poſitively juſt by grace at the ſame time) which is but the carcaſſe of unrighteouſneſſe, making the ſinner unrighteous, no otherwiſe then as it were materially, he doing that which on his part is ſufficient to oblige him to condemnation: but he is never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally unjuſt, becauſe the grace of his Judge prevents his actual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SO much for Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> firſt Propoſition: upon which I have been<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> neceſſitated to dwell the longer, becauſe his diſcourſe is ſo perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intricate. In that which follows I ſhall be more brief. His next Propoſition is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If Juſtification be taken not for the Will of God, but for the thing willed, to wit, our diſcharge from the Law, and deliverance from Puniſhment; ſo it hath for its adequate cauſe and principle, the death and ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſubſtance of this Propoſition I could gladly cloſe with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſomething is firſt neceſſary to be animadverted. 1. Whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> here makes the ſatisfaction of Chriſt the adequate, and (as in his Explication he tells us often) the immediate cauſe of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if by adequate and immediate he mean only <hi>in genere cauſae me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriae,</hi> I conſent, becauſe there is no other meritorious cauſe that comes between the death of Chriſt and our Juſtification. But if he mean, that the death of Chriſt is ſimply the adequate and immediate cauſe, then I deny it: becauſe the act of God as Juſtifier, comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the death of Chriſt and our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:116045:30"/> 
                     <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi>—that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth on Jeſus. And the Lord Jeſus himſelfe alſo, as Lord of ſoules, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all judgement committed to him by the Father, joynes in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the ſame act of Juſtification, which was merited in his blood, as we before obſerved. 2. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath been diſputing hitherto, that Gods Will not to puniſh is our Juſtification: That by which we are ſecured from wrath, diſcharged and acquitted from all ſin and wrath: yea, that it was a real diſcharge from condemnation: an actual and compleat non-imputation of ſin. But now he tells us, that the death of Chriſt is the adequate and immediate cauſe of our diſcharge from the Law, and freedome from puniſhment. I think (for my part) it is beyond mans ability to invent or utter more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable contradictions. To be ſecured from wrath, and not ſecured: acquitted, and not acquitted: diſcharged and not diſcharged: what can be more contradictorious? or who can conceive what is that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, diſcharge and acquittance from all ſin, wrath, puniſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which yet leaves a man under the power of a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, and without freedome from puniſhment, till Chriſt buy it with the price of his blood? 3. Our diſcharge from the Law, and freedome from puniſhment may be underſtood, either <hi>de jure,</hi> in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off our obligation unto puniſhment; (and this cannot be the effect of the death of Chriſt; for Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth over and over de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the Elect did ever ſtand obliged by the judgement of God, to the ſuffering of puniſhment, as the Reader ſhall largely ſee below in the debate of <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3.) or it may be underſtood <hi>de facto,</hi> in the real and actual removal of all kindes and degrees of puniſhment: but neither can this be the effect of the death of Chriſt, by it ſelf, or with the former. <hi>The Purpoſe of Gods Will</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> chap. 10. §. 10. pag. 108.) <hi>ſecures the perſon ſufficiently, and makes the Law of condemnation to be of no force, in regard of the real execution of it.</hi> So that what is left for the death of Chriſt to do, I muſt profeſſe I cannot imagine; ſeeing the act of our Juſtification, and our diſobligation from wrath, and our real impunity do all exiſt by vertue of another cauſe. But for further confirmation of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> refers us to <hi>chap.</hi> 14. where we ſhall wait upon him, and ſay no more to it till we come thither: His third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Juſtification is taken for the declared ſentence of abſolution and<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> forgiveneſſe:</q> and thus God is ſaid to juſtifie men, when he reveales

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Underſtand (<hi>Reader</hi>) that when we ſay, Juſtification is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſentence of abſolution, it is not meant of a private manifeſtation made to a particular perſon that himſelf is juſtified or pardoned: but of that publike declared Law of faith, namely, the Goſpel it ſelf, which is to be preached to every creature under heaven, <hi>He that believeth ſhall not periſh, but ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> By which Promiſe, whoſoever believeth, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſin. 2. I wonder Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not give us throughout his whole book, ſo much as one text, wherein Juſtification muſt ſignifie a manifeſtation or declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to a perſon that he is juſtified: and yet tell us here that Juſtification is ſo taken. If he mean, it is ſo taken in Gods lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, let him ſhew where: if in mans, I will not diſpute with him how men take it. And as to that text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 13. me he reſtored, but him he hanged, (which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth here inſtance in, to prove that things in Scripture are ſaid to be, when they are only manifeſted) if he had conſulted <hi>Junius,</hi> he would have told him, that the word (<hi>He</hi>) relates not to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but to <hi>Pharaoh.

I conſent, that God hath declared his immutable Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to impute ſin to believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Word: and particularly in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe given to our firſt Parents. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116045:31"/> (in act or habit) the remiſſion of ſins paſt, and entring him into a ſtate of remiſſion for the future, doth alſo further declare ſomething of the ſame purpoſe. 4. That the ſame purpoſe of God is ſometime or other in ſome meaſure manifeſted, to moſt true Chriſtians by the work of the Spirit. But whether every true Chriſtian hath a full aſſurance of this purpoſe of God towards himſelfe: or any, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon their firſt believing (at leaſt in theſe dayes) I am in doubt. 5. And that our Juſtification in the great day of judgement, doth moſt fully, perfectly and finally declare the ſame purpoſe, as being the moſt perfect, compleat and formal juſtification of all. And ſo much for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>genius</hi> and iſſues of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> doctrine: I come next to a vindicaiton of my own.</p>

But before he gives his anſwer to particular places, he thinks fit to informe the Reader, that I began my Sermon, and concluded it with a great miſtake. The miſtake in the beginning is, that I ſaid the Apoſtles ſcope in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> was to prove, <hi>That we are juſtified by faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:116045:31"/> i. e. that we are not juſtified in the ſight of God before we beleeve; and that faith is the condition on our part, to qualifie us for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which is a miſtake I intend to live and die in by the grace of God. The Apoſtle tells us himſelf, that his ſcope is to prove, that both Jewes and Gentiles are all under ſin, <hi>Rom. 3. 9. and that by the deeds of the Law, neither Jew nor Gentile ſhall be juſtified in Gods ſight,</hi> ver. 20. that ſo he may conclude Juſtification by faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and if this be not to prove that men are unjuſtified but by faith, I know not what is. And that faith here is to be taken properly, we prove at large below. If this be not the Apoſtles ſcope, what is? <q>Why (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) to ſhew that we are juſtified, not by works or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in us, but by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt freely imputed to us: which we apprehend and apply by faith.</q> Very good: and this is as much as I ſtand for: namely, that we are juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt apprehended by faith. But know (<hi>Reader</hi>) that when we ſpeak of apprehending Chriſts righteouſneſſe, we mean not an intellectual apprehenſion, when a man comes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and know that he is juſtified, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth) but the right and intereſt which is given us by the Promiſe in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, when we believe. And in this ſenſe are our Proteſtants to be underſtood, when they ſay, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith.

                  </p>
                  <p>The miſtake in my Concluſion was, that I told unbelievers, that<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Chriſt was not a High Prieſt or Advocate to them, and that they had no Court of Mercy to appeal unto: which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies to be true. If he mean, they may appeal by faith, I conſent; but that is nothing to his purpoſe. If, that they may appeal without faith, or that Chriſt intercedes that their ſins may be forgiven, who yet live in impenitency and unbelief, let him prove it. Of this alſo I ſhall ſpeak
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:116045:32"/> more, when I come to debate how farre we are reconciled in the death of Chriſt. In the mean time, I wonder why Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould quarrel with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> for aſſerting univerſal Redemption in the ſenſe of <hi>Davenant, Cameron, Teſtardus, Crocius, Amyraldus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when in the words following he yields the main foundations of their judgements in this point; namely, when he ſayes, <q>Our duty is to exhort all men every where to believe in Chriſt: we were as good bid the devils to believe, as thoſe for whom Chriſt is not a High-Prieſt.</q> I inferre, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt died for all men, (though I ſay not for all equally) or elſe we were as good preach the Goſpel to divels as to men. But let that paſſe. After Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath leaped from one end of my Sermon to the other, he comes to the middle, which indeed doth moſt concern him. And whether he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of errour in that alſo, is our next enquiry.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, he conſiders that place, (which was then my text) <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> His anſwer is double.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I would never deſire that any Argument of mine ſhould conclude more firmely, then that text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. will infer, that none are the children of God in the ſenſe there meant, before they love their enemies, and performe the other duties there enjoyned: for it is manifeſt the Lord there ſpeaks of becoming the children of God, not by adoption, but by ſimilitude of manners. Reader, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 46, 47, 48. and give judgement impartially. Now in this way it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be a childe of God, till theſe things be done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that part of the anſwer ſtrengthens my Argument. 2. To <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. where God is ſaid to have ſet forth his Son, &amp;c.—that he might be juſt; I anſwer, that there is no neceſſity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the word <hi>juſt,</hi> of being known and acknowledged to be juſt: for it will be a kinde of tautologie. <hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſſe, That he may be declared to be righteous.</hi> Nor yet will it follow, that God was not juſt before; but that he had not been juſt now, if Chriſt had not ſuffered for ſinners. But if by the word <hi>juſt,</hi> be meant, declared to be juſt, it will not reach our caſe. We ſeek ſuch a ſenſe of the word Juſtification, when God is the juſtifier, and man the object, (which throughout all Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> book is a <hi>non-inventus;</hi>) when man is the juſtifier, and God the object, ſuch a ſenſe is neceſſary: becauſe God is capable of no other Juſtification from man, as man is from God. 3. As to the thing it ſelf, I acknowledge it readily, That things are many times ſaid to be in Scripture, when they are only manifeſted and declared to be; but ſuch an interpretation is ſeldom warrantable, unleſſe the ſubject-matter invite to it, as in <hi>John</hi> 15. and 13. where the Lord ſpeaking to thoſe that were already diſciples, that if they brought forth much fruit, they ſhould be his diſciples; it is moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to underſtand it of being manifeſted, or of continuing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But we may not therefore interpret Juſtification by faith, of a manifeſtation or declaration that we are juſtified: not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the texts wherein that phraſe is uſed, ſuppoſe no Juſtification before it; but alſo, 1. Becauſe other Scriptures deny them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, to be juſtified, <hi>John 3. 18. Rom. 3. 19, 22, 23, 24. 1 Cor. 6. 9, 11. Eph.</hi> 2. 3. and other places. And 2. Becauſe when <hi>to be</hi> in Scripture, ſignifies to be <hi>manifeſted</hi> or <hi>declared,</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood perpetually of an external publike manifeſtation or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to many; not of an internal, ſpiritual, private diſcovery to the ſoule or conſcience of a particular perſon: for proof of which, I deſire no other witneſſe then theſe very texts, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116045:33"/> here mentioned, ſuppoſing them all to be underſtood as he would have them. Our love to our enemies declares us to be the children of God: our bringing forth much fruit, declares us to be the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, both publikely and in the ſight of many witneſſes: God is declared to be juſt, ſtill publikely, and in the judgement of many: yea, of all, good or bad, men or devils. But this ſenſe will by no meanes fit Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> turne, for he contends for no more then, that Juſtification is manifeſted upon faith, to the believers own conſcience: nor do I think he will ſo much as pretend, that he that believes, is by his faith publikely declared to the world to be a juſtified perſon. So that neither can Juſtification by faith be allowed, to be underſtood of a declarative Juſtification; nor if it might, could it yet at all gratifie his deſign.</p>
                  <p>Of all places it cannot have that ſenſe in this text. 1. Becauſe<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Juſtification by faith is expreſſely oppoſed to Juſtification by works. <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law: for by the works of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> But it is moſt certain, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> confeſſeth it roundly, that works do manifeſt and declare our Juſtification, <hi>page 79, 80. Ergo,</hi> by Juſtification here, is not meant the declaration or manifeſtation that a perſon is juſtified. 2. Juſtification in regard of its common nature is the ſame, whether it be by faith or works: namely, as it ſignifies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of us juſt before God; for Chriſtians attain that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by faith, which the Jewes ſought after by works: as the Apoſtle doth more largely expreſſe it, <hi>Rom. 9. 31, 32. Iſrael</hi> which followed after the Law of righteouſneſſe, have not attained to the Law of righteouſneſſe: Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Juſtification, when aſcribed to faith, muſt be taken in the ſame ſenſe, as when it is denied to works. But the Jewes by their works ſought to be juſtified before God, and not ſimply, that it ſhould be manifeſted to them, that they were juſtified before their works were wrought: for they ſought to be juſtified by works, as the matter for which they ſhould be juſtified. And therefore when the Apoſtle oppoſeth himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to their principle, it is in theſe words. <hi>By the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified;</hi> that is, in the ſight of God: as it is expreſſed by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 2. and by this Apoſtle in this Argument, <hi>Rom. 3. 20, 21. Gal. 3. 11. Ergo,</hi> to be juſtified by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116045:34"/> faith in this place, is not ſimply to be aſſured of a mans Juſtification, but to be juſtified before God. 3. And becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth uſe to oppoſe Juſtification by faith, to Juſtification by Chriſt; I deſire him to conſider, that Juſtification by faith, is here the very ſame with Juſtification by Chriſt; for after he had ſaid, <hi>ver. 16. We have beleeved in Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt,</hi> he addes, <hi>ver. 17. but if while we ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt.</hi> But to be juſtified by Chriſt, is not meerly to have it by Chriſt declared that we are juſtified. This is not only a conceſſion, but a main principle of Mr. <hi>Eyres. Ergo,</hi> to be juſtified by faith here, is not ſimply to have the knowledge of our Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath another anſwer, a very ſtrange one, and that<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> is this. <q>In the text it is, <hi>We have believed, that we might be juſtified by faith:</hi> ſo that from hence it can be inferred only, that we are not juſtified by faith before believing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> As if the queſtion between the Jewes and the Apoſtle were not, whether a man be juſtified ſimply by faith, or works? But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man were juſtified by faith, by faith or works? and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles anſwer is to this effect; That indeed if you ſpeak of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, we are juſtified by faith, and not by works. He that hath nothing elſe to do, may exerciſe his wits farther upon this <hi>acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> if he pleaſe. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> mean no more, then that we are not juſtified in conſcience before we believe, (as the latter words of his anſwer ſeem to import) then is this ſecond anſwer a meer tautologie, as being the very ſame with the former.</p>

                     </gap>: Whom, Them. So that the object of vocation is a perſon predeſtinated: of Juſtification a perſon called: of glorification a perſon juſtified: or elſe thoſe particles are utterly ſuperfluous, and the whole ſentence ridiculous. 4. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will alſo acknowledge, that in two of theſe Propoſitions, not only connexion, but order is obſerved: namely, in the firſt; whom he predeſtinated, them he called: and the laſt; whom he juſtified, them he glorified. Yet hath he as much reaſon to deny both theſe, as the middlemoſt. And if <hi>Arminians,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no abſolute election before faith, ſhould deny the firſt; and a Sadducee, who confeſſeth no reſurrection but what is paſt already, ſhould deny the laſt: he could not vindicate the text againſt either, but by the ſame Arguments, which will convince himſelf of errour in denying the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>5. But what doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> meane to make us beleeve, when he<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> tells us, he can ſee no inconvenience at all, in ſaying the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of Juſtification, as declared in conſcience; whereas one would think it had been eaſie to ſee, that he is liable to a double ſhrewd inconvenience in ſo ſaying: the one is of contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the other, of abuſing the text. 1. The Apoſtles ſcope here (ſaith he) is not, to ſhew in what order theſe benefits are beſtowed upon us. I wonder in which of them he breaks order. In the firſt and laſt Propoſition (as was but now obſerved) it will ſurely be granted, that he keeps order punctually: and when he ſaith in the ſecond Propoſition, whom he called, them he juſtified; I am ſure Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf will acknowledge, that he hath hit the order as right as can be, if by Juſtification be meant that which is terminated in conſcience (as he ſpeaks.) And why then doth he deny, that the Apoſtle intends to declare the order of theſe benefits? belike, though his ſcope were not to do it; yet he had the good hap to ſtumble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, quite beſides his purpoſe and intention. 2. But neither can it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116045:35"/> be underſtood of Juſtification in conſcience; for the Juſtification here ſpoken of, is only and entirely Gods act: no leſſe then Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, Vocation, and Glorification: But Juſtification in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the act of conſcience, reaſoning and concluding a mans ſelfe to be juſt: and as for the expreſſion of Juſtification terminated in conſcience, let me here once for all declare againſt it; not only as not being Scriptural, but as not being very rational. For that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Juſtification is terminated, is that which is juſtified. But it is the man, and not his conſcience, which is juſtified. <hi>Erge,</hi> it is the perſon, and not the conſcience properly, upon which Juſtification is terminated. <hi>Paſſio</hi> as well as <hi>Actio</hi> is <hi>propriè ſuppoſiti.</hi>

As ſuppoſe (which yet I do wholly deny) that a mans purging himſelf, do only manifeſt and declare that he is a veſſel of honour; yet ſurely his purging of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is antecedent to that declaration or manifeſtation. As the holding faſt our confidence is alſo antecedent to our being declared to be the houſe of God.

Our knowledge, that righteouſneſſe is imputed to us is our own act: but the imputation of righteouſneſſe in the text is Gods act, not ours, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.

But it is like when he wrote that, he had forgotten what he had ſaid before in this place. 2.

And (ſaith the Apoſtle) in this chapter, <hi>ver. 4. To him that worketh, the reward is not imputed of grace, but of debt.</hi> Hence it follows, that that imputation is here meant, which hath no work of ours for its cauſe. But faith is clearly the cauſe of our knowing righteouſneſſe to be imputed: and that as it is a work of ours. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſſe here ſpoken of, is not our knowing or being aſſured that it is imputed.</p>

                     <hi>to give the believer a right to bleſſedneſſe, as his reward:</hi> the word <hi>Reward</hi> being taken in that more laxe and metaphorical ſenſe, in which the Scriptures uſe it, when they call <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> by <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> by that name. And as the whole ſalvation of believers is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by its two termes, to wit, <hi>They ſhall not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but ſhall have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3. 16. ſo in Juſtification there is a right given to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from puniſhment, (which is the <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus à quo,</hi>) in which reſpect it is called the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and non-imputation of ſin: of which the Apoſtle gives an inſtance out of <hi>David, ver.</hi> 6. 7, 8. and a right to the more poſitive bleſſings of heavenly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life by the Promiſe, (which is the <hi>terminus ad quem</hi>) in which reſpect it is called <hi>Juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 18. of which alſo he giveth us an inſtance in <hi>Abraham, ver.</hi> 13. for the Promiſe, that he ſhould be heire of the world, &amp;c. In reference to which part or terme of Juſtification, it is in ſpecial manner, that <hi>Abrahams faith is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe:</hi> for though thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were things, which in the letter were carnal; yet in ſubſtance and ſignification they were ſpiritual, and ſo did he underſtand them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14, 15. and 11. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Now that this is the true notion of the phraſe, (<hi>imputing faith unto righteouſneſſe</hi>) namely, a rewarding of the believer with a right to bleſſedneſſe, I gather from <hi>ver. 4, 5. To him that worketh, the reward is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of grace, but of debt: but to him that worketh not, but believeth, his faith is imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> Where the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faith unto righteouſneſſe, is directly oppoſed to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a reward according to works. <hi>Ergo,</hi> as the imputing works unto righteouſneſſe, were to give a right to bleſſedneſſe according to works, <hi>ſub ratione mercedis:</hi> ſo on the contrary, to impute faith unto righteouſneſſe, is to give the beleever a right and title to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, <hi>ſub ratione mercedis.</hi> The difference only is this: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is of debt, the latter of grace, as we ſhall further ſhew anon. 2. Thus alſo we finde the Apoſtle interpreting the phraſe; for after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116045:37"/> he had ſaid, <hi>that Abraham was made the father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that righteouſneſſe might be imputed unto them alſo,</hi> ver. 11. he explains himſelf, <hi>ver. 13. for the Promiſe was not to Abraham or his ſeed by the Law, but by the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> The reaſon whereof he renders, <hi>ver. 16. That it might be by grace, that the Promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> So that the eſtabliſhing of the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all that walk in the ſteps of his faith, (by which a right to life is given both to him and them) is the imputation<note place="margin">Vid.

Then ſtood up Phineas, and executed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—And it was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe, unto all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations for evermore.</hi> The meaning of which words is eaſie to be learned from the ſtory it ſelf, <hi>Numb. 25. 12, 13. Wherefore ſay, Behold, I give unto him my Covenant of Peace. And he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſthood.</hi> The Promiſe of the continuance of the Prieſthood in his line, from one generation to another, as the reward of his zeal, is that which the Pſalmiſt calls, <hi>the imputing it to him unto righteouſneſſe to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</hi> Indeed the phraſe there is not altogether ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as it is here, becauſe the Promiſe made him was but of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bleſſing, and ſo could not conſtitute him righteous univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but only in part, and as to that particular bleſſing which the Promiſe gave him right to. Yet it ſhews the Scripture-ſenſe of the phraſe as ſufficiently, as when the ſame phraſe is uſed with reference unto faith, to ſhew, that thereby we obtain the reward of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal righteouſneſſe. 4. The imputation of righteouſneſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> is all one with the non-imputation of ſin, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 8. and what is it to non-impute ſin, but not to render the wages of ſin, by deſtroying the guilt and puniſhment of it? 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 19. 2 Tim. 4. 16. Ergo,</hi> to impute faith unto righteouſneſſe, is to reward it with a right to impunity and bleſſedneſſe: though this reward be not of debt, but of grace. This therefore being the ſenſe of the phraſe throughout the whole Chapter, we leave Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> gloſſe to go ſeek entertainment where it can finde it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the two former Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. <q>That the giving of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and receiving it, are two things. The former is Gods act, and the latter is ours. A Prince may pardon a Malefactour, and he thereby is ſecured from puniſhment, though it come not to his hands for a good whiles after.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The word <hi>receive</hi> in Scripture is taken ſometimes actively; as when we are ſaid <hi>to receive God and Chriſt, and his Word,</hi> Matth. 10. 40. John 13. 20. Acts 2. 41. namely, <hi>by believing.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken paſſively, in which ſenſe, giving and receiving are not two acts, but one and the ſame; as when we are ſaid <hi>to receive the reward of inheritance,</hi> Col. 3. 24. <hi>to receive eternal life,</hi> Luke 18. 30. <hi>to receive a hundred fold,</hi> Matth. 19. 29. In all which (and the like) places, our receiving is all one with Gods giving <hi>the reward of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, eternal life, a hundred fold.</hi> And thus <hi>to receive remiſſion of ſin,</hi> is all one with Gods giving remiſſion, or to have our ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and pardoned. In this ſenſe do our Proteſtants underſtand <hi>Receiving remiſſion through faith,</hi> as was before obſerved out of <hi>Contarenus.</hi> So do the Scriptures alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. All are concluded under ſin, <hi>That the Promiſe</hi> (to wit, of Juſtification) <hi>by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that beleeve.</hi> In which place, Gods gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving righteouſneſſe by the Promiſe, and our receiving it, are one and the ſame act: compare <hi>ver.</hi> 14. 18. So <hi>Rom. 5. 17. They that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reigne in life, &amp;c.</hi> Whence alſo it is manifeſt, that Gods giving, and our receiving, are both one act. Therefore this giving or receiving of righteouſneſſe, is called, <hi>the coming of grace or righteouſneſſe upon us,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:116045:38"/> ver. 18. <hi>As by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men unto Juſtification.</hi> 2. The receiving of remiſſion muſt be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe, as the receiving of the inheritance: for they are joyned both together in the text, <hi>Acts 26. 18. That they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſin, and an inheritance.</hi> But for us to receive the inheritance, is no more, then to be made partakers of the inheritance: not by any act of ours, but by the free and effectual gift of God. 3. To receive remiſſion, what act of ours is it? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not tell me plainly, but by his anſwers to former texts, and his inſtance here of a Malefactour pardoned before he knowes it. I preſume he meanes, that it is our knowledge of our ſins being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But ſuch a knowledge is not wont to follow ſo preſently and immediately upon believing, as pardon of ſin is every where in Scripture ſuppoſed to do: (unleſſe it be in thoſe who have the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of the moment and minute of their firſt Converſion unto God.) But moſt Chriſtians attain not to ſuch a knowledge, till after long ſearchings and experience: and it is very improper to ſay, a man <hi>receives</hi> ſuch an act of his own, which himſelfe works out with much labour and travel of minde: if our knowledge of remiſſion were by immediate revelation, or enthuſiaſtical inſpiration, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion were much more tolerable. 4.

When the Scriptures do ſo conſtantly require faith unto Juſtification, and faith only: (for proof of which, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> confeſſeth, my Concordance would furniſh me with many more places then I have taken notice of) I will never be brought to beleeve, that it is required as a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Juſtification: for all Chriſtian graces and duties are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as conſequents, as well as faith, (even by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> grant.) Nor yet that by Juſtification is meant our knowledge and aſſurance, that we are juſtified: becauſe unto that alſo many other things may be required, and not faith only. As for example, ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and proving of our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. diligence, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one grace to another, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 10. a good conſcience towards God and man, and a keeping of the Commandments of Chriſt, 1 <hi>John 3. 20, 21. John</hi> 14. 23. love of the brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19, 14. and the like.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the Vindication of the Texts, proving Faith's antecedency to Juſtification. By all which the Reader may ſee, that when I ſaid, the only anſwer made to theſe Texts was, That Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is to be underſtood of that which is evidenced in conſcience; this account is true and perfect, though Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tell him it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect; there being not one of all the places mentioned, but what he anſwers to by ſuch a temperament of the word Juſtification. It was therefore neceſſary that I ſhould prove, that when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle pleads for Juſtification by faith, he is to be underſtood of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God, and not of that which is in the Court of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To which end I advanced foure Arguments in my Sermon: the aſſerting of which againſt Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> exceptions, is my next under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>

The Queſtion between him and the Jewes was not, whether we were declared to be juſtified by faith or works, but whether we were juſtified by faith or works in the ſight of God. And he concludes, that it is by faith, and not by works, <hi>Rom. 3. 20, 21. Gal.</hi> 3. 11. All this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> grants; but will have the Apoſtle by the word <hi>faith</hi> to underſtand, not the act or habit of faith, but the object; <hi>ſcil.</hi> Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or righteouſneſſe imputed. His reaſon is, becauſe elſe there were no oppoſition between faith and works: ſeeing faith or the act of believing is a work of ours no leſſe then love. Yet when the Apoſtle diſputes for Juſtification by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. and that in a direct oppoſition to works, and for the imputation of faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. ſtill as oppoſed to works, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. we were told that juſtifying and imputing were the manifeſtation of Juſtification and Imputation: But now we have another anſwer, which overthrows the former; namely, that faith is to be taken for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116045:39"/> Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe? <hi>What aileth thee, O Jordan, that thou art turned backward?</hi> Yea, he will not allow, that the Apoſtle hath any queſtion with them about the time when, or the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet I think all men beſides himſelf will grant, that his deſigne is to ſhew the way and meanes, by which a ſinner may come to be juſtified. Though I confeſſe I ſee not how Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> can grant this. For if the Juſtification of all that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, be abſolute and perfect in the death of Chriſt, (as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) then from that time there can no way be preſcribed to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, no counſel given him, what courſe to take, that he may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Only he may be told, that if he be juſtified, the way to know it, is to beleeve. And when the Jewes ſay, <hi>We muſt be juſtified by works,</hi> and the Apoſtle, <hi>By faith:</hi> they are both out, for we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by neither. And the Gentiles were in an errour, in ſeeking to be juſtified <hi>by faith,</hi> as well as the Jewes in ſeeking it <hi>by works:</hi> if they ſeek any thing more then to know that they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth ſo often take Sanctuary at this noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that ſaith is put for its object, Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, (though he give us not one text that may convince us of it) we muſt of neceſſity examine the truth of it.

                  <p>1. SUch an Interpretation of the words, as makes non-ſenſe of moſt<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of the Scriptures, which ſpeak of Juſtification by faith, is not to be admitted. But to put faith for Chriſt beleeved on, makes non-ſenſe of moſt of thoſe texts, which ſpeak of Juſtification by faith. <hi>Ergo.</hi> For proof of the <hi>minor,</hi> we ſhall begin, where the Apoſtle begins to diſpute for Juſtification by faith, <hi>Rom. 3. 21, 22. But now the righteouſneſſe of God without the Law is manifeſted, even the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> put <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>Chriſt believed or,</hi> and the words run thus, <hi>Even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by Chriſt of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or put it for <hi>the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> and they run thus, <hi>Even the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all that beleeve.</hi> Almoſt the very ſame words doth this Apoſtle uſe, <hi>Phil. 3. 9. That I may be found in him, not having my own righteouſneſſe, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith.</hi> Where, in like manner, if <hi>faith</hi> be put for <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> we muſt reade the words thus, <hi>Not having my own righteouſneſſe, but that which is through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God through righteouſneſſe.</hi> I hope the Reader doth not expect, that I ſhould ſpend time in confuting theſe abſurd para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes: I count that ſufficiently done in mentioning them. In the ſame Chapter to the <hi>Romanes, ver. 25. Whom God h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>h ſet forth, to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> According to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> we muſt reade it, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Chriſt in his blood;</hi> or at beſt, <hi>through righteouſneſſe in his blood.</hi> But his blood being here ſet forth, as the object of the faith mentioned in the text: the blood of Chriſt muſt be made the object of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, if by faith be meant righteouſneſſe: which will reſolve the words into a pretty piece of ſenſe. Again, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. God through the death of Chriſt, is ſaid to be the Juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus. What's that? of him that chriſteth in Jeſus? or what is it? It is an eaſie matter to ſay, that faith is put for Chriſt or his righteouſneſſe: but the miſchief is, the ſubſtantive cannot be varied
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116045:40"/> into a verbe or participle, to make an intelligible Propoſition; for example, <hi>We are juſtified by faith:</hi> that is, (will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſay) by Chriſt, or his righteouſneſſe. But then change the ſubſtantive into a verbe or participle, and give me the ſenſe of it. As, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in Chriſt is juſtified.</hi> If faith be put for Chriſt, what is it to beleeve in Chriſt? or what do we mean, when we ſay, <hi>We are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt? We are juſtified by</hi> Chriſt <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> or <hi>by</hi> righteouſneſſe <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> This latter, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, hath a more tolerable ſound, but not a grain more of ſenſe. For when we ſay, <hi>We are juſtified by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt in that Propoſition is the object of faith, and we the ſubject. But if faith ſignifie righteouſneſſe, then Chriſt is the object of his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Of the non-ſenſe of this Interpretation, the Reader ſhal ſee more in that which follows. 2. Juſtification by Chriſt or his righteouſneſſe was finiſhed in his death, (according to Mr. <hi>Eyre) Ergo,</hi> if faith ſignifie Chriſt or his righteouſneſſe, we were juſtified by faith, as ſoon as Chriſt was dead. But many yeares after Chriſts death, there were many who were <hi>to be juſtified by faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 30. It is one God <gap reason="foreign">

We conclude, <hi>That a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. Ergo,</hi> they were not juſtified by faith as ſoon as Chriſt was dead.</p>
                  <p>3. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> by his marginal Annotation, referres us<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. let us make ſome enquiry into that Chapter. And if we prove, that faith in that Chapter, is meant of the act, not of the object, this controverſie is ended. We begin with the third verſe, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> What can be more plain, then that it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing which was imputed to him, (of the ſenſe of that phraſe we have ſpoke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) even as when it is ſaid of <hi>Phineas, Pſal. 106. 30, 31. Then ſtood up Phineas, and executed judgement.—And it was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> I appeal to common ſenſe, whether his executing of judgement were not the thing that was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe? or if ſomething be to be underſtood which is not expreſſed: let every mans fancie be left to its liberty, to ſupply what he ſees ſit, and we ſhall be much the better for the Scriptures. 2. The ſame is alſo delivered more generally of all believers, <hi>ver. 5. To him that worketh not, but beleeveth, his faith is imputed to him unto
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116045:41"/> righteouſneſſe.</hi> If there had been no more ſpoken in all the chapter, this had been enough to prove, that by faith here is meant the act, not the object. For 1. It is the expreſſe letter of the text, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth.</hi> 2. That faith is here meant, which is a mans own, before it be imputed. <hi>His faith is imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> But the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is no mans before it be imputed. If it be, let us know what act that is, diſtinct from imputation, and antecedent to it, by which Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is made ours. 3. That faith is here meant, which is ſo a mans owne, as that <hi>in individuo</hi> it is no bodies elſe. But Chriſts righteouſneſſe is not ſo any one mans, as to be no bodies elſe: for then ſhould be but one man in the world, to whom the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt were imputed. The Propoſition is manifeſt: becauſe the faith here ſpoken of, is determined to the perſon of the beleever. <hi>To him that beleeveth,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>HIS faith is imputed.</hi> And it is called the faith which <hi>Abraham HAD</hi> in his uncircumciſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And the truth is, that otherwiſe (I mean, if <hi>His faith</hi> be <hi>His Chriſt) Abrahams</hi> faith, or <hi>Davids</hi> faith, or any other Chriſtians faith may be ſaid to be imputed unto us, with the very ſame propriety of ſpeech, as it is ſaid to be imputed to him or them. 4. If <hi>faith</hi> be here put for <hi>Chriſt or his righteouſneſs,</hi> the words are non-ſenſe. Put <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and the words run thus. <hi>But unto him that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, his righteouſneſs is imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> What ſenſe is that? or put it for Chriſt, and they run thus, <hi>But unto him that believeth, his Chriſt is impured to him unto righteouſneſs.</hi> But what is it to impute Chriſt unto righteouſneſſe? I know he is ſaid <hi>to be made unto us righteouſneſs; 1 Cor. 1. even as he is made unto us Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To ſay nothing of the inſolency of that phraſe (<hi>His Chriſt</hi>) in Scripture; and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſt, as diſtinct from his righteouſneſſe, the object of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith.</p>
                  <p>3. We have already proved, that to impute faith unto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> is to reward the believer with a right to life. If then faith be put for Chriſt; to impute faith unto righteouſneſſe, is to reward Chriſt with righteouſneſſe. And if for righteouſneſſe, it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward righteouſneſſe with righteouſneſſe: both which are abſurd. 4. The faith which was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> unto righteouſneſſe, was the faith which he had, being yet uncircumciſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. If faith do here ſignifie Chriſts righteouſneſſe, the words ſound thus,

                     <hi>The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which he had in his uncircumciſion, was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> And becauſe he could not have it but by imputation, therefore the full ſenſe will be this. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, which was imputed to him in his uncircumciſion, was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> Spectatum admiſſi, &amp;c.</p>

And the father of circumciſion, &amp;c.</hi>) The like Argument doth this Apoſtle uſe elſewhere, <hi>Gal. 3. 9. They which be of the faith, be bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> 2. If we become children of the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, then <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith ſignifies his believing, and not Chriſts righteouſneſſe. The reaſon is, becauſe to be a childe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, is to follow or imitate him, in that which is called his faith (as when Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> calls me a ſonne of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> faith). And if we are like him by believing, then believing is the quality wherein the ſimilitude conſiſts, between him the Father, and us the children. But we become the children of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, (even that very faith <hi>which was imputed to him unto righteouſneſſe) by believing,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>The father of all them that beleeve,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>That walk in the ſteps of father Abrahams faith, Who are alſo called the ſeed of the faith of Abraham,</hi> ver. 16. 3. And I would, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> or ſome body elſe, would make ſenſe of the Apoſtles words, if <hi>faith</hi> be put for <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe, ver. 12.

                  <p>2. When we ſpeak of Juſtification by works, and of Juſtification<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> by faith, the particle (<hi>By</hi>) hath not the ſame ſenſe in both Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. But in the former it denotes works to be that very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for which a perſon is juſtified: in the latter, it denotes faith to be the meanes or condition, upon which we receive the gift of Chriſts righteouſneſs. Of the uſe of that particle in ſuch a ſenſe, the Reader ſhall finde many inſtances in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ninth Chapter. When then he diſputes, that if we are juſtified by faith in a proper ſenſe, we are juſtified by works, becauſe faith is a work; I deny the conſequence with the proof of it. The former, becauſe to be juſtified by faith, is to be juſtified by the righteouſneſſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other through faith, as the condition of the application and donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it unto us: but to be juſtified by works, is to be juſtified by and for a righteouſneſſe wrought by our ſelves. The latter, becauſe faith is not a work, as the Apoſtle uſeth works: that is, no part of that righteouſneſſe for which we are juſtified. What can be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt this, the Reader will meet with in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. In the mean time, I deſire him to have recourſe hither for anſwer to this Argument, in all the following places (which are very many) wherein it is objected againſt me: that I may not be forced to multiply tautologies, even unto nauſeouſneſſe.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                  <p>THe ſecond general Argument proving, that Juſtification by<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> faith, is not meant of the evidence or knowledge of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is this. It cannot be imagined how faith ſhould evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us our Juſtification but one of theſe three wayes. Either as an Argument affected to prove it, or axiomatically, or ſyllogiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (which termes, becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> reproacheth me with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, we ſhall endeavour to explain as we come to them). But we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in reference to faiths e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing our Juſtification in any of theſe three wayes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, becauſe of faiths evidencing our Juſtification. This (Reader) is the ſumme and ſcope of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument: which I have here ſet down diſtinctly, that thou mayeſt not be lead into a miſtake, common to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> with ſome of my own friends (as themſelves have told me) as if I had deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all uſe of faith, in evidencing Juſtification: which is as farre from my judgement, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt. I confeſſe I have little cauſe to blame Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> or others for being thus miſtaken: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is an <hi>ellipfis</hi> in my words, which might give ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a miſapprehenſion; for whereas it is ſaid (in my Sermon, <hi>page</hi> 3.) It is a moſt unſound Aſſertion, that faith doth evidence our Juſtification before faith. The full ſentence ſhould have been this. It is an unſound Aſſertion, that we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, becauſe that faith doth evidence our Juſtification before faith. The proof of this is the manifeſt tendency of every branch of this Argument, and of each Argument under each branch. And I am apt to think Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf ſo underſtood me, when he comes to particulars; for he doth not once charge them with impertinency, (which he might have done with advantage enough, if it had not been clear, that they were all levelled at another ſcope, then ſimply to prove, that faith is of no uſe to evidence Juſtification.) As to the thing it ſelf, I am ſo far from denying faith to evidence our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that I do aſſert as followeth. 1. As the word <hi>evidence</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that which is affected to argue another thing, ſo faith doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence our Juſtification, yea, and is the firſt thing that doth evidence it. 2. Faith doth alſo evidence Juſtification axiomatically to all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116045:44"/> thoſe that have a particular teſtimony from God, that they are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. As thoſe whom Chriſt tells in the Goſpel, <hi>that their ſinnes were forgiven them,</hi> Matth. 9. 2, 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 20, 23. and 7. 47, 48. If any man now living hath the like teſtimony from God, that his ſins are forgiven, he hath no better way to evidence it to himſelfe, then without any more ado, to beleeve that they are forgiven. 3. Faith doth alſo concurre to the evidencing of Juſtification ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtically, but then the whole evidence is not of faith, as we ſhall ſhew by and by. I do therefore acknowledge the uſe of faith in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing Juſtification, in all thoſe wayes by which it may be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; though not of faith only in the laſt, nor at all in the ſecond; unleſſe there be any man that hath heard God ſaying to him, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Come we on then to the proof of particulars. And firſt, that we<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in reſpect of faiths evidencing our Juſtification as an Argument, or particularly as an effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. To evidence Juſtification as an Argument, is no more then for faith to have ſuch a relation unto Juſtification, as that where the one is, the other muſt needs be alſo: and he that knows the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have to each other, cannot but know that where faith is, there Juſtification muſt needs alſo be. Even as laughing and crying may be ſaid to evidence reaſon in a childe (though it may not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it to the childe himſelf, becauſe he knows not the dependance of theſe actions upon his reaſon) ſo we ſay, where there is ſmoak there is ſome fire. Groanings argue ſome ill affection in the body, and generally every effect doth argue and evidence its cauſe, to them that know the connexion between the cauſe and effect. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> diſclaims faiths evidencing in this way: though in anſwer to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24. above debated (of his Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 44. §. 6.) he hath as plainly yielded it as can be, in theſe words, <q>Hereby we may know and be aſſured, that Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed to us, that we, whether Jewes or Gentiles, are the perſons to whom this grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; if God hath drawn our hearts to beleeve and obey the Goſpel: in regard that none do or can beleeve, but ſuch as are ordained to life, and to obtain ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</q> What is this, but that faith doth evidence our Juſtification as an Argument: ſeeing that where one is, the other is alſo: where there is faith there is Juſtification. It ſeems the ſame thing is good Divinity out of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> mouth: but out of mine, an errour. Yet though Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not owne, that faith doth evidence Juſtification in this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116045:44"/> way, he thinks fit to give his Reader, his ſenſe of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>There are therefore three Reaſons in my Sermon, why we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in reſpect of faiths evidencing our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as an Argument. The firſt is this. Becauſe then Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, is not neceſſarily ſo much as Juſtification in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A Chriſtian may have faith, and yet not have the evidence that he is juſtified. As a childe may laugh and cry, and yet not have the evidence or clear knowledge, that himſelfe hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, 1. <q>By intimating, that this agrees not with what I allege out of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. to prove, that if our hearts condemn us, God doth much more condemn us. 2. If faith did evidence only as a ſigne, it would be a dark and unſatisfying evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 3. Nothing that precedes faith, doth prove a man juſtified: nothing that follows it, is ſo apt to prove it as faith it ſelfe. 4. Whereſoever there is faith, there is ſome evidence of this grace. In the leaſt ſpark of fire, and the leaſt twinkling ſtarre, there is ſome light.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> To the firſt I ſay, that it never came into my minde to prove, that God condemns every one, whom his own conſcience condemns: but that if conſcience condemns truly, then the judgement thereof is according to the judgement of God, and ſo God condemns as well as conſcience. But if a beleevers heart ſhall tell him that he is not juſtified, and his ſins not pardoned; his conſcience is erroneous and judgeth otherwiſe then God judgeth. 2. The two next anſwers are like chips in pottage, that do neither good nor hurt, as I ſee. When I can underſtand, whether they make with me or againſt me; I ſhall conſider them farther. 3. The fourth anſwer, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath faith, hath ſome evidence of his Juſtification, (for that he meanes by <hi>grace,</hi> or elſe its nothing to the purpoſe) I deny utte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: if by <hi>evidence</hi> he mean, not that which would prove it, if it were rightly underſtood: but a mans actual knowledge that he is juſtified. And how doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove it? why, the leaſt ſpark of fire hath ſome light, and the leaſt twinkling ſtarre. True. So the leaſt degree of true faith hath that in it, which if it were rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended would make ſome diſcovery that a man were juſtified. But theſe ſparks of fire <hi>give</hi> no light at all, when they lie buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaps of aſhes: and ſuch black and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116045:45"/> but not thoſe of greateſt magnitude. And the Scripture teſtifieth, not only poſitively, that a gracious ſoule <hi>may walk in darkneſſe;</hi> but to expreſſe the greatneſſe of this darkneſſe, addes an univerſal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. <hi>And may ſee no light,</hi> that is, (as <note n="f" place="margin">Childe of light. <hi>page 5. 6, 8, 9, 10.</hi>

                     </note> heard of in ſuch a condition? If it be ſaid, we may be miſtaken in men; I acknowledge it. But withal, I am not bound to beleeve impoſſibilities and contradictions. If I muſt beleeve that it is poſſible for them to have true faith, even whiles they have not the leaſt ſpark or twinkling evidence of Gods juſtifying pardoning love: then I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> affirmation to be univerſally true; That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is faith, there is ſome evidence of Juſtification. And (me thinks) he ſhould not have expected, that we ſhould take his word againſt Scripture and experience both. 2. Yet if all this were granted, it comes not up to our caſe, when the Scriptures ſay, <hi>He that believes ſhall be juſtified:</hi> it ſurely ſpeaks of a Juſtification, which is the ſame equally unto all that beleeve. And for Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to ſay, every one that believes hath ſome evidence of Juſtification, though it may be not ſo much as another, is to ſay, one believer may be more juſtified then another, which we deſire him to prove, the Scriptures imply the contrary, <hi>Romanes</hi> 3. 29, 30. and 4. 23, 24. and 10. 12.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument, to prove that we are not ſaid to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> by faith, in reſpect of faiths evidencing our Juſtificarion as an effect, was, becauſe faith is not the effect of Juſtification: for if it be, then we may as truly be ſaid to be faithed by our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as to be juſtified by our faith: and in ſtead of ſaying, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and thou ſhalt be juſtified;</hi> we muſt ſay hence-forward, Thou art juſtified, therefore beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That he ſees no abſurdity at all, in ſaying, That faith is from Juſtification cauſally. That grace which juſtifies us, is the cauſe and fountain of all good things, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of faith, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 1. Phil.</hi> 1. 29.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Is it then no abſurdity, to ſet the Scriptures upon their heads? we are ſaid in Scripture to beleeve unto righteouſneſſe or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116045:45"/> Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. and were it no abſurdity to ſay, we are made righteous, or juſtified unto believing? when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. we are not of them who draw back unto perdition: but of them that beleeve unto the ſaving of the ſoule. Surely the particle <hi>unto</hi> doth in both ſentences denote the iſſue and conſequence: in the former, perdition of drawing back: in the latter, ſalvation of believing. 2. Faith cannot be the effect of Juſtification: if Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes it is, namely, the eternal Will of God, not to puniſh, preciſely; for a Will determined preciſely to a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punition is not the cauſe of faith, unleſſe Gods not puniſhing be our believing. 3. And what an Argument have we to prove faith to be the effect of Juſtification? That grace which juſtifies us is the cauſe of all good things, and particularly of faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe of faith. This is Logick of the game. The grace that juſtifies us, is alſo the grace that glorifies us: ſhall I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infer that glorification is the cauſe of faith?</p>
                  <p>I did therefore truly ſay, that according to this doctrine, we muſt<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> not ſay, <hi>Beleeve, and thou ſhalt be juſtified;</hi> but rather, thou art ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; <hi>Ergo</hi> beleeve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>No (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>) becauſe 1. It is not the priviledge of all men. 2. We know not who are juſtified, no more then who are elected. Though faith be an effect of Election, yet we may not ſay, Thou art elected, therefore believe.</q> 3. When the cauſe is not <hi>noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Indeed to be juſtified is not the priviledge of all men: yet Juſtification is to be preached as a priviledge attainable by all men, if they will beleeve: which yet it cannnt be, if Juſtification be the cauſe of faith, and not the conſequent. 2. It is alſo true, that we cannot ſay, Thou art elected, therefore beleeve; neither may we ſay, Beleeve, and thou ſhalt be elected. But we may and muſt ſay, <hi>Beleeve and thou ſhalt be juſtified;</hi> therefore the caſe of Election and Juſtification is not the ſame. The third anſwer I underſtand not, nor I think no man elſe; at leaſt, how it ſhould be applied to the preſent caſe: and therefore I ſay nothing to it.</p>
                  <p>My laſt, and indeed the main Argument for proof of the poſition,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> namely, that we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in reſpect of faiths evidencing our Juſtification as an Argument, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as an effect, is this; becauſe then it will unavoidably follow, that we are juſtified by works as well as faith: works being an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116045:46"/> effect evidencing Juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ication as well as faith.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, 1. By retortion. That this follows from my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; for if we be juſtified by the act of beleeving, we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a work of our own. For anſwer to which, I refer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the ſecond and third Sections of this chapter. If works be taken largely, for any humane action, faith is a work; but it is (as I may ſo call it) an <hi>unworking</hi> work; for to beleeve and not to work, are all one with the Apoſtle, as we have ſhewed before out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5. His ſecond anſwer is a large grant, that works do declare and evidence Juſtification; and therefore I take notice only of the laſt line of it, wherein he quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. as proving faith to declare and evidence Juſtification to conſcience. Of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 16. I have already ſpoken largely: and have proved, that the Apoſtles words, <hi>We have beleeved that we may be juſtified,</hi> cannot have this ſenſe, we have beleeved that we may know our ſelves to be juſtified. And I wonder Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not ſee how he ſtumbles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, at the common rock of contradicting himſelf, in alleging that text. He here acknowledgeth, that works do evidence our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but the Apoſtle there doth altogether remove works from having any hand in the Juſtification there ſpoken of. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Juſtification there ſpoken of, is not the evidencing of Juſtification. The words in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. are theſe. <hi>Therein</hi> (namely in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) <hi>is the righteouſneſſe of God revealed from faith to faith.</hi> That is, (as the Apoſtle expounds himſelf, <hi>chap. 3. 21, 22.) In the Goſpel is manifeſted the righteouſneſſe of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all that beleeve:</hi> from beleeving Jewes to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles; for that queſtionleſſe is the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>from faith to faith;</hi> as is manifeſt, by comparing them with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>ver. 16. The Goſpel is the Power of God to ſalvation, to every one that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eveth; to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek.</hi> But how this proves, that to be juſtified by faith, is to have the evidence of Juſtification in our conſciences, I cannot divine.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gives us his direct anſwer, or rather ſomething<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> like an anſwer, and denies that works do evidence Juſtification as well as faith: where note (Reader) that the words (<hi>as well</hi>) are not a note of parity (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> miſtakes them, I doubt, not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly) but of ſimilitude: for I do not mean, that works do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with an equal degree of clearneſſe or certainty; but in the ſame way or manner, or that they are an evidence of the ſame kinde and nature as faith is, if faith evidence barely as an effect. And ſo
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116045:46"/> we may be ſaid to be juſtified by works, by the very ſame reaſon as we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith; if to be juſtified by faith be no more, then by faith as an effect, to know that we are juſtified: which is that which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will never be able to anſwer while he lives. But let us ſee what he ſayes for his denial of works to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as well as faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt (ſaith he) they do not evidence ſo clearly and certainly as faith doth: becauſe works may proceed from principles of natural ingenuity and morality. 2. Works do evidence in the judgement of charity and before men: but not in the judgement of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or with that clearneſſe and demonſtrative certainty which the conſcience requires.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> All this is nothing. <hi>Majus &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem.</hi> If works evidence Juſtification in the ſame way and manner as faith doth, though not with ſuch a perfect degree of evidence as faith doth; then are we juſtified by works as well as by faith: if to be juſtified be to know that we are juſtified. 2. The Scriptures tell us that works (Chriſtian and ſpiritual works) are a very clear and certain evidence, 1 <hi>John 3. 14. We know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. with <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. It is true, there may be works like good works, which are not ſo in truth; and there may be faith like true faith, which yet is not faith unfeigned: but when works are brought to the light, and manifeſted that they are wrought in God, they are a very ſure evidence: as ſure (for ought I know) as faith it ſelfe, though I will not diſpute it, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8.

Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo (Reader) that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth here, (as alſo in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) diſtinguiſh between faith and works: and yet, to oppoſe me, will not allow that we are juſtified by faith, becauſe faith is a work.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſſe to the next branch of this Argument, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) that in the cloſe of this, I added theſe words: <hi>Whether works be the firſt effect (namely of Juſtification</hi>)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116045:47"/> 
                     <hi>or the ſecond, and by conſequence the firſt evidence or the ſecond, is not at all material in this caſe: becauſe the Apoſtle, when he denies Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works, excludes works altogether,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. and 4. 5. The Reaſon why I added, <hi>this,</hi> was, Becauſe when Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Argument againſt Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> all the anſwer he could get was this Queſtion; Whether Works were the firſt evidence, or the ſecond? The impertinency of this Queſtion I thought fit to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by obſerving that the Apoſtle denies to works any influence at all, into that Juſtification which he ſpeaks of: and therefore he ſpeaks not of Juſtification by way of evidence, whether firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But the principal intent of the Argument, was to prove the main Concluſion, That the Apoſtle, when he diſputes for Juſtification by faith, cannot be underſtood of Juſtification declared in couſcience, for works have an efficiency in producing that Juſtification. But the Apoſtle rejects works from having any hand at all in that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification which he diſputes for. Therefore he meanes not Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in conſcience. To this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath held it his wiſeſt courſe to ſay nothing. If he ſhould have diſtinguiſhed of works (as that he muſt do, if he do any thing) he knows well enough what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he had put into my hands againſt himſelf. Whether this be an Argument of a minde deſirous to advance the truth, the day will make manifeſt.</p>

That man is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature. That two make four, or the like. Theſe things are evident to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at firſt view, without any farther proof. And there is a double evidence in all ſuch aſſent. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116045:47"/> one is the evidence of the object, or the truth aſſented to, which muſt be clearly repreſented in the Axiome or Propoſition. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſubject, which is the light of reaſon within us, by which we aſſent to a Propoſition of evident truth, and have the clear knowledge thereof. Even as unto our ſeeing of any thing, there muſt concurre an external light to make the object viſible; and internal ſight in the eye, to evidence the ſame object to each man in particular; for though the light ſhine never ſo clearly, a blinde man can ſee nothing: nor the moſt quick-ſighted, without outward light. The caſe is the ſame in ſupernatural verities: as, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God; that he is come into the world to ſave ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhall be ſaved,</hi> and the like. Which things, becauſe they are above the reach and comprehenſion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon, therefore our mindes aſſent not to them, nor have the evidence of them, till they be informed with a more ſupernatural light and principle, namely faith, which is the eye and ſight of the ſoule, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26, 27. Hence the Apoſtle in that chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. deſcribes <hi>faith to be the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> and ſayes, <hi>ver. 3. By faith we know the world was made by the Word of God.</hi> That God made the world is evidenced objectively by the Word, which ſaith; <hi>that God made the Heavens and the earth, Gen.</hi> 1. 1. but it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced unto us, unleſſe we beleeve that Word. And ſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, if any perſon (ſuppoſe <hi>Peter</hi>) have by faith the evidence of his Juſtification, immediately or axiomatically, it muſt be by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſome Axiome or Propoſition of divine revelation. <hi>Thou</hi> Peter <hi>art juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we come now to prove, that we<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, becauſe of faiths evidencing our Juſtification axiomatically. Two reaſons I gave of it. 1. Becauſe ſuch an immediate evidence of a particular mans Juſtification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had without a particular teſtimony from God, Thou <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> art juſtified. But there is no ſuch thing written in Scripture, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no ſuch evidence can be had.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaith, <q>I miſtake the nature of juſtifying faith, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be a bare intellectual aſſent to a Propoſition:</q> which yet is quite againſt my judgement, and that which I do purpoſely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my next argument. I conſent to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> in placing faith, partly in the underſtanding, and partly in the will. But our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is now concerning that faith which is in the underſtanding, how <hi>Peter</hi> (for example) comes to know, or to be aſſured by faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116045:48"/> that he is juſtified? And this (ſay I) muſt be by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of faith to ſome ſuch Axiome, Propoſition, or Word of God, as was but now mentioned, <hi>Thou</hi> Peter <hi>art juſtified.</hi> Even as <hi>Paul</hi> was aſſured, that neither himſelf, nor any that were in the ſhip with him ſhould periſh, by beleeving the teſtimony of God ſent him by an Angel, <hi>Acts</hi> 27 25. And becauſe there is now a dayes no ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a particular mans Juſtification, therefore there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof to be had this way, (at leaſt ordinarily) and if there were, yet I would not call that faith juſtifying faith, but rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing faith.</p>
                  <p>His Anſwer to the Argument is large, and (to me) very confuſed. He excepts againſt my terme of an axiomatical evidence (I would change it, if I could deviſe any terme more ſignificant) but at laſt, yields it me; yet thinks it fitter to ſay, faith evidenceth organically as it is the organ or inſtrument whereby we do apprehend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Chriſt. But we ſhall ſhew fully, that this organical evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt be reduced to one of thoſe three by me mentioned, and cannot make a fourth way of evidence, diſtinct from them. The ſumme of his anſwer is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That faith is ſuch an aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel, as that withal the ſoule taſtes an ineffable ſweetneſſe in the ſame: and he that taſtes the ſweetneſſe of Goſpel-Promiſes and grace, knows his intereſt and propriety therein: for all manner of ſweetneſſe is a conſequent and effect of ſome propriety which we have in that good thing which cauſeth it.—And ſo faith doth evidence our Juſtification axiomatically, by aſſenting to, and withal taſting and reliſhing thoſe indefinite and general Propoſitions, Invitations and Promiſes that are held forth to us in the Goſpel, which by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unſcrutable work of the Spirit, are applied and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the ſoule of a true beleever: for otherwiſe he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſte any ſweetneſſe in them.</q>

Yea, ſo ſeparable is ſweetneſſe from faith, that ſometimes on the contrary, exceſſe of ſweetneſſe hath hindred and overcome faith: as it was in the diſciples, who for very joy beleeved not, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 41. and with old <hi>Jacob</hi> in a like caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 26. 2. I alſo deny, that there can be no manner of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe taſted in the Goſpel, but by ſuch as have intereſt and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the grace thereof.

A taſte of ſweetneſſe in the Goſpel, doth evidence to the ſoule ſenſibly and experimentally, that God and his Word are good: which may be an Argument to prove that he is juſtified. But it neither doth nor can <hi>actually</hi> evidence it to him, unleſſe there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene another act of the minde, concluding himſelf to be juſtified, according to the Promiſe made to ſuch a faith. Sugar will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence its ſweetneſſe to my taſte: but my taſting will not evidence to me actually that I am a living creature, unleſſe I conclude it by the diſcourſe of my minde: becauſe according to the rules of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, None can taſte but a living creature. Beaſts can taſte as well as men, yet-they do not know that they are living creatures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot compare their act with the rule according to which they act: which ability in the reaſonable ſoule, is uſually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a power of reflecting upon its own act. The caſe is much the ſame in Infants. Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> organical evidence is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame with that which I call faiths evidencing as an Argument: or if he underſtand it of that which is not only affected to prove, but doth actually prove, then it is the ſame with that which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low call ſyllogiſtical: as being an act of the ſoule, concluding its own Juſtification, from the ſweetneſſe it taſteth in the Promiſes. 4. But the truth is, it is a moſt prepoſterous courſe, to ſend the ſoul for its evidence of right and intereſt in the Promiſes, to a taſte of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116045:49"/> ſweetneſſe in them: which will quickly appear, if Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical expreſſions be made more grammatical. Wherefore, to taſte ſweetneſſe in the Promiſes, is either an act of the underſtanding, judging of the Promiſe <hi>ſub ratione b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ni convenientis,</hi> as a moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good: and thus, it is a knowledge antecedent to faith, or at moſt but the beginning of faith it ſelf, <hi>Gal. 2. 16. Knowing that a man is not juſtified, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, we have believed,</hi> Or it is an act of the Will, embracing, delighting, and taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in the Promiſe, as his beſt good: and then it follows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, not upon our right and intereſt in the Promiſe, but upon our knowledge of that right: for as we deſire not that which we do not know; ſo neither can we rejoyce in a right which we know not. The Queſtion then returnes, <hi>viz.</hi> how the ſoul comes to know its right and intereſt in the Promiſe? To ſay, it knows it by taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in it, is to ſay it delights in it knows not what; for the will follows the judgement: and to take complacency in a good, which we do not know we have a right in, is naturally impoſſible. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> therefore may ſpeak truly, when he ſayes, He that taſtes the ſweetneſſe of Goſpel-grace knows his intereſt therein (ſuch the taſte may be); but we are never the wiſer in the underſtanding of the main queſtion: <hi>viz.</hi> How the ſoule comes to the knowledge of his intereſt in that Promiſe, in which he taſtes ſo much ſweetneſſe? from anſwer to this, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> makes an eſcape under the darkneſſe of his metaphorical expreſſions. 5. I deſire alſo to know, whether it be the Promiſe of pardon and Juſtification, in which the ſoule taſtes ſuch ſweetneſſe, as thereby to have the evidence of his Juſtification, or ſome other? If ſome other, how is it poſſible that faith ſhould evidence to me my pardon and Juſtification, by taſting ſweetneſſe in that truth which promiſeth no pardon or Juſtification at all? If it be the Promiſe of pardon, let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſee that he conſiſt with himſelf. Promiſes are eſſentially <hi>boni futuri,</hi> of a future good. Therefore according to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> there can be now no Promiſe of pardon or Juſtification. Not of the Act, for that is paſt from all eternity: not of the Effect, for that is paſt as long as ſince the death of Chriſt: and therefore neither the one nor the other can be the object or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Promiſe. It remaines then, that it is the Promiſe of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting and declaring Juſtification. But then behold the ſenſe. My faith doth evidence to me that I am juſtified, by reliſhing the Promiſe which God hath made of manifeſting and declaring Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Hence it follows, that I have the evidence of my Juſtification
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:116045:49"/> by beleeving that I ſhall have it. And then either my faith muſt be falſe, or the Promiſe muſt be falſe; for if I do already know that I am juſtified, that knowledge cannot be future: elſe the ſame thing might be and not be at the ſame time. But there can be no falſhood either in a divine faith, or in a divine teſtimony. And I deſire alſo Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to reconcile what here he ſpeaks of faiths evidencing, with the Interpretations given before of thoſe ſayings in Scripture, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeves ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins, Acts</hi> 10. 43. and 26. 18. That receiving (ſaith he) is our act, not Gods; namely, our knowing our ſelves to be juſtified. Here he makes it intrinſecal to faith to beget aſſurance, as it is a taſte of ſweetneſſe in the Promiſe, that is, in the Promiſe of manifeſting Juſtification: for no other Juſtification is capable of being promiſed. Lay all this toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one or both theſe two things muſt be the reſult, either that I know I am juſtified, before God manifeſt it to me (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and thereby know that I am juſtified: and the Promiſe which I beleeve is, that God will manifeſt my Juſtification to me. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath not yet manifeſted it,) or elſe the great Promiſe of juſtifying them that beleeve muſt be reſolved into this ridiculous piece of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. He that hath the evidence of his Juſtification, ſhall have the evidence of his Juſtification; for in that he believes he hath this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and the thing that is promiſed is, that he ſhall have this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not limit the evidence of faith, to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the ſweetneſſe of indefinite and general Promiſes: but there muſt concurre withal a ſecret and inſcrutable work of the Spirit, to make theſe general Promiſes particular. It is not the firſt time I have been acquainted, both at home and elſewhere, with Pretenders to aſſurance in ſuch a way; whoſe lives and ends I have known ſo well, that I ſhall (for their ſakes) eſteem it no other whileſt I live, then a carnal, groundleſſe, enthuſiaſtical preſumption.

                     </note>) Mr. <hi>Shepheard.</hi> But the former hath not a word of making the general Promiſe particular, but ſaith only, That the particular manner of the Spirits working this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our ſoules, (namely, that now we reliſh ſpiritual things, which naturally we taſte no ſweetneſſe in) is a myſtery inſcrutable, to which I conſent. The latter (whoſe memory is very honourable and precious to me) was the moſt violent oppoſer of this doctrine of any man on earth, that ever I knew or heard of: his works ſhew
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116045:50"/> ſomething of it; but they that knew him can teſtifie more. I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent to him, that in vocation the Spirit makes the general call particular, according to the ſenſe in which he explaines himſelfe in the place quoted. The ſoule (ſaith he) at this inſtant, feeles ſuch a ſpecial ſtirring of the Spirit upon it, which it feeles now, and never felt before: as alſo its particular caſe ſo ſpoken to, and its particular objections ſo anſwered, and the grievouſneſſe of its ſin, in refuſing grace ſo particularly applied, as if God ſpake only unto it. All this I beleeve to be true, but it is nothing in the world to our purpoſe. To make the common motives and invitations unto faith, to become in this manner particular in their operation, upon particular perſons, doth neither affirme nor deny any thing concerning the ſtate and condition of thoſe perſons. But to evidence to a man immediately that he is juſtified, muſt be by a particular teſtimony: and that as diſtinct from the teſtimony of Scripture (which ſaith only that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are juſtified) as a proper or particular Propoſition from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore, 1. That the Spirit evidenceth to no man that he is<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> juſtified, who hath not at the ſame time the evidence of his faith: and ſo is this evidence of the Spirit alwayes, (at leaſt) implicitly ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſtical. And the ſoule can have no ſetled comfort in it, but by analyſing the <hi>crypſis,</hi> and reſolving the whole evidence into its parts, after the manner below ſpecified. <hi>He that beleeveth is juſtified.</hi> But I beleeve, <hi>Ergo</hi> I am juſtified. The caſe is ſo plain to me, that I appeal to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf for judgement. If a man ſhall come to him and ſay, Sir, I am aſſured by the Spirit of God that I am ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and that all my ſins are pardoned, but whether I beleeve or no, or ever did, that I cannot tell: Would he allow this perſwaſion to be of God? If not, then doth not the Spirit teſtifie to any man imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately that he is juſtified: but the evidence of the Spirit (as I ſaid before) is, if not expreſſely, yet implicitly ſyllogiſtical. If ſo, I would thus convince the Pretender from Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> principles. He that doth not believe, cannot be aſſured that he is juſtified. But thou doſt not believe, <hi>Ergo</hi> thou canſt not have aſſurance (from the Spirit) that thou art juſtified. What will be here denied? Not the <hi>major,</hi> for that's an undoubted truth, grounded in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> interpretation. Not the <hi>minor:</hi> for the man whom we are now convincing. of his errour, in pretending to aſſurance by the Spirit, is ſuppoſed not to know whether he have faith or no. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot truly ſay he hath faith, though he have it: becauſe to affirme that for truth, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116045:50"/> we do not know to be true, is a lie, though the thing ſhould be ſo as we ſay. <hi>Ergo</hi> he muſt yield to the Concluſion, that his aſſurance is not from the Spirit: elſe the teſtimony of the Spirit is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to that of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> words do alſo contradict themſelves notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> Firſt, he tells us, that faith evidenceth our Juſtification, by aſſenting to, and taſting the general Propoſitions of the Goſpel: then he tells us that thoſe general Propoſitions are made particular by the Spirit to a beleever: otherwiſe he could taſte no ſweetneſſe in them. To tell us, that faith evidenceth by taſting general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and then to ſay in the ſame breath, that it can taſte no ſweetneſſe in general Propoſitions, but they muſt be firſt made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by the Spirit, is to ſay and unſay. 3. Accordingly the general Propoſitions in the Goſpel, muſt firſt be made particular by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, before the ſoul can taſte any ſweetneſſe in them, for which I confeſſe there is all the reaſon in the world: for the object appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended muſt be before the act apprehending: the Propoſition aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and taſted, muſt be before the act aſſenting and taſting. But then hence it will follow, that a man before he believes hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular teſtimony from the Spirit, that he is juſtified. For this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, thus made particular by the Spirit, is the object of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and taſte, that is, of his faith, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it exiſts before his faith; even as the general Promiſes in the Word exiſt before we can believe them. But to ſay, it is evidenced to any man before he believes, that he is juſtified, is that which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hitherto diſowned, as well he may.</p>
                  <p>A mans faith (ſuppoſe <hi>Peters</hi>) can evidence no more to him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively,<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> then the Word doth evidence to him objectively; even as the eye can ſee no other thing then what the light makes manifeſt. But this Propoſition, <hi>He that believes is juſtified,</hi> doth not evidence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively immediately that <hi>Peter</hi> is juſtified; for the former is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the latter is proper. And otherwiſe, every one in the world that believes that Propoſition, might thereby have the evidence of <hi>Peters</hi> Juſtification, as well as of his own. Even as we know by faith, that they to whom the Lord ſaid, <hi>Your ſins are forgiven you,</hi> were juſtified as well as themſelves. And all believers (one as well as another) know by faith, that the world was made by the Word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. becauſe the Scriptures ſay ſo. <hi>Object.</hi> But the Spirit makes this general Propoſition to be particular unto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anſw.</hi> I ask, whether the Scriptures be not equally the rule
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116045:51"/> of all mens faith? If not, then neither of their obedience: which will introduce Antinomianiſme with a vengeance. If ſo, (as moſt undoubtedly ſo) then this particular teſtimony of the Spirit, is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Peters</hi> faith: which I farther argue thus. It is no object of <hi>Pauls</hi> faith, that <hi>Peter</hi> is juſtified. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is no object of <hi>Peters</hi> faith. The reaſon is, becauſe the rule of all mens faith, is one and the ſame equally. Therefore the faith of Chriſtians is called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith, <hi>Tit. 1. 4. the faith of Gods elect, ibid. ver.</hi> 1. which is but one, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5. But if <hi>Peter</hi> beleeve upon the teſtimony of the Spirit, that which <hi>Paul</hi> cannot, or hath no ground to beleeve upon the teſtimony of Scripture, then <hi>Peters</hi> faith doth not act by the ſame rule that <hi>Pauls</hi> doth: but there will be as many rules of faith, as there be perſons in the world, that pretend to this particular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>5. To conclude, to make a general Propoſition particular, is to<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> change the ſubſtance and nature of it: for it cannot be general and particular too, (though I readily grant, as before, that a truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in common may be made particular, in reſpect of its effectual operation upon one, and not upon another: but the Propoſition it ſelf remaines general ſtill.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> this particular teſtimony of the Spirit, muſt be ſome other then that of Scripture (unleſſe by being made particular be meant no more, then that a particular is infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of a general, which is a ſyllogiſtical evidence, not axioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> now diſputes for). But I do wholly deny any ſuch particular teſtimony of the Spirit, for which there is not ſo muth as <gap reason="foreign">

The Spirit beareth witneſſe with our ſpirits that we are the children of God,</hi> (which text Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not mention, and therefore I anſwer it, for the ſake of ſome others.) Compare this verſe with the foregoing, and with a parallel place to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and it will not be difficult to give the right ſenſe of it, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Becauſe you are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Sonne into our hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> So <hi>Rom. 8. 15.

But the Spirits working in us liberty in our acceſſes

                  <p>MY ſecond Argument, to prove that faith doth not evidence Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> axiomatically, was this. The faith which juſtifies, is that which is to be preached and preſſed upon the whole world. But we cannot preſſe it upon every man in the world to believe that he is juſtified, and that if he doth not beleeve this, he ſhall be damned.</p>
                  <p>Underſtand (<hi>Reader</hi>) that the direct tendency of this Argument is to prove, that juſtifying faith is not a mans aſſurance that he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: which I preſumed was Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> judgement: becauſe that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification which is in Scripture made an immediate conſequent of believing, is (with him) a knowledge that we are juſtified. I thought therefore that he had held faith to be an aſſurance: becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a man might beleeve, and yet not be juſtified by faith. And ſo the proving that faith was not an aſſurance, would withal have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it doth not evidence Juſtification axiomatically or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. But now I perceive, that he doth not place the formality of faith in an aſſurance: but rather makes this an eſſential property and effect of that (if I underſtand him.) And ſo I confeſſe this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is not directly againſt him. Nevertheleſſe, it will not be amiſſe to examine his anſwer: for (if I miſtake not) either he muſt make faith to be an aſſurance tantamount: or elſe he contradicts himſelf. His anſwer therefore is this. <q>We do not preſſe every man to believe that he is juſtified; but to beleeve, 1. <hi>Aſſenſu intellectus,</hi> to acknowledge that there is a ſufficiency of merit in Chriſt for the Juſtification of ſinners. 2. <hi>Amplexu voluntatis:</hi> to accept, embrace, and cleave unto Jeſus Chriſt.</q>

                        </gap>.</note> own it, if he will be true to his own principles. 1. He hath told us before, that faith is eſſentially <hi>aſſenſus cum guſtu,</hi> an aſſent, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116045:52"/> a taſte of ſweetneſſe in the Promiſe aſſented to. But this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance muſt concurre, to make the Promiſe an object of my faith, namely, that I have right and intereſt therein; otherwiſe I can taſte no ſweetneſſe in it: that is, otherwiſe I could not truly beleeve it; for to taſte ſweetneſſe is eſſential to faith: Wherefore, when we preſſe all men to believe, and all men equally, and that with a true faith, it is ſuppoſed that all men have equally a right in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; or elſe they are commanded to beleeve, without an object to be believed: for the object of faith is the Promiſe, in which I have right and intereſt, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> And this is that which I ſay is tantamount, to a perſwading of all men to beleeve that they are juſtified. To argue it a little farther. The right which I have in the Promiſe, is either antecedent to my faith, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it. If antecedent, I have what I would; for then, when in the preaching of the Goſpel, the Promiſe is propoſed as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that faith, which we perſwade all men to, the right of all men equally in that Promiſe muſt be preſuppoſed; it being not the Promiſe ſimply, but the Promiſe in which men have right, that is the object of faith. If conſequent, then the firſt act of faith cannot be a taſte of ſweetneſſe in the Promiſe; becauſe till I beleeve, I have no right in the Promiſe, and therefore can taſte no ſweetneſſe in it, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To what he here ſayes, that we preſſe all men to believe, there is<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> a ſufficiency of merit in Chriſt, for the Juſtification of ſinners: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the ſumme of that which the ſoul aſſenteth to, and taſteth ſweetneſſe in, and thereby immediately comes to know its own Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we muſt endeavour to underſtand more particularly. 1. By ſinners, he meanes all, or ſome only. 2. The ſufficiency of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt muſt be underſtood, either as diſtinguiſhed from their efficiency, and then the meaning is, That Chriſt merited Juſtification for men ſufficiently, yet they are not thereby actually juſtified; or as including their efficiency: and then the meaning is, that men were actually, and moſt ſufficiently juſtified in the meritorious death of Chriſt. 3. The ſame ſufficiency of Chriſts merits may be conſidered either abſolutely and in themſelves, in reſpect of their own intrinſecal worth and value; or relatively and ordinatively, in reference to the ordination and intention of God in giving up his Son to death; and of Chriſt, in giving up himſelf: which diſtinctions being premiſed, it were an eaſie matter to ring the changes upon the foreſaid Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vary it into innumerable formes: but I ſhall mention no
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116045:52"/> more then I muſt needs. When then it is ſaid, that every man is to beleeve, that there is a ſufficiency of merit in Chriſt for the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners; the meaning muſt be either, 1. That the merits of Chriſt were of themſelves ſufficient to have purchaſed Juſtification for all ſinners, (though they did not purchaſe it <hi>de facto</hi> for any.) This is falſe. Or, 2. That Chriſts merits are indeed ſufficient for the Juſtification of all ſinners; but the effect (which is the actual Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners,) is ſuſpended till we beleeve. Nor can this be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be believed by all men equally: for it is falſe in reſpect of the Elect, who (according to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) were juſtified actually ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred yeares ago in the death of Chriſt Or, 3. That the merits of Chriſt were ſufficient for the Juſtification of all ſinners: but were never ordained to be effectual to the Juſtification of all, upon any termes or conditions whatſoever. Nor can this be the Promiſe or Propoſition, which is the object of our juſtifying faith, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre;</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe ſuppoſing that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in the world ſhould beleeve this, (which is no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore may be ſuppoſed as poſſible) yet they ſhould not be juſtified notwithſtanding: ſeeing Chriſt never intended that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhould be juſtified by his blood, upon any termes. Or, 4. That the merits of Chriſt were ordained of God and Chriſt, to the obtaining of Juſtification for every ſinner moſt ſufficiently, if they ſhould or would believe. This is moſt true, but Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> rejects it, as too much gratifying thoſe that are for Univerſal Redemption in the groſſeſt ſenſe, which is a needleſſe feare: and the two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he here propoſeth againſt it, he might have ſeen long ſince anſwered by Reverend and Learned Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> (of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory) in his Diſſertation <hi>De Morte Chriſti, cap. 3. page</hi> 22, 23, 30, 31. In ſhort, let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſtate his Propoſition how he will: To ſay, the merits of Chriſt are ſufficient, and but ſufficient (before faith) to Juſtification, is that which the Elect cannot believe without errour. To ſay they are ſufficient in reference to their own value, and intrinſeca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I am perſwaded the devils beleeve it: and it cannot be denied, but that the merits of Chriſt were a price of themſelves ſufficient to have purchaſed ſalvation for them, (yea, and to have turned all the ſtones in the ſtreets into men, and to have glorified them in Heaven.) And it is very ſtrange, that a ſoule ſhould be drawn to Chriſt, upon a ground common to divels

                  <p>THe third branch of my Argument ſucceeds. Namely, that we<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in reference to faiths evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing our Juſtification ſyllogiſtically. Two Reaſons I gave of this. The firſt is, becauſe there cannot be found out a <hi>medium</hi> before faith it ſelfe, &amp;c. The farther Explication the Reader may ſee in my Sermon.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That it is not needful. It is ſufficient that faith it ſelfe is the <hi>medium,</hi> as thus. He that beleeveth, was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before faith. But I beleeve.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Argument remaines good for the purpoſe, for which I advanced it. For I not knowing certainly in what ſenſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would maintain that faith did evidence, could conjecture at none more probable, then that he placed the nature and being of juſtifying faith in the evidence, knowledge or aſſurance of our Juſtification. Upon which preſumption, as I had before proved, that it was not <hi>aſſenſus axiomaticus,</hi> an axiomatical and immediate aſſent to this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am juſtified; ſo in this Argument my intent was to prove, that neither was it <hi>aſſenſus ſyllogiſticus,</hi> an aſſent to the ſame Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, deduced by way of Concluſion out of premiſſes. And this the Argument proves invincibly. Let us ſet Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſyllogiſme before us, and the matter will be plain. He that beleeves, was juſtified before faith. But I beleeve. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I was juſtified before faith. Hence it is manifeſt, that the faith which I affirme of my ſelfe in the <hi>minor,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt eſſentially in my aſſent to the Concluſion: for then the Syllogiſme would conſiſt but of two Propoſitions. This is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſcope of the Argument, which now I know Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> minde better, I ſee well enough, doth him but little hurt, and therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not on the vindication of it. Nor yet may the Reader charge me for arguing impertinently; ſeeing it was neceſſary I ſhould ſuppoſe and confute what might be ſaid, when I did not know what would be ſaid. I know no other way I had to get out of Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> his ſenſe of faiths evidencing. Yet becauſe I did eaſily foreſee he might
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116045:53"/> give that anſwer, which here he doth, I added the next Argument, which meets with it to the full.</p>
                  <p>If we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, becauſe faith doth evidence<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> Juſtification ſyllogiſtically, then may we be ſaid as well to be juſtified by ſenſe and reaſon, as by faith: becauſe ſenſe and reaſon concurre with faith in a ſyllogiſtical evidence. As thus. He that believes is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. But I beleeve, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am juſtified. The Propoſition only is the aſſent or act of faith. The Aſſumption an act of ſenſe or ſpiritual experience. The Concluſion an act of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That the Concluſion is of faith.</q> As in this Syllogiſme. <hi>All men ſhall riſe from the dead.</hi> I am a man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſhall riſe from the dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> That the Concluſion is <hi>de fide,</hi> is ſaid, not proved (and I would that way of diſputing were leſſe frequent with Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>).

In the preſent caſe, the matter is clearer then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is aware of. We will ſuppoſe <hi>Peter</hi> to be the man that makes the Syllogiſme. <hi>He that believes, is juſtified.</hi> But I beleeve. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am juſtified. When he faith in the <hi>minor,</hi> I beleeve; he is ſuppoſed to ſpeak, not only of that faith, which sin the Will, accepting and embracing a promiſed good: but of that ialſo, which is in the underſtanding aſſenting, <hi>omni credibili,</hi> to all truths propoſed to be believed. But (according to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) it is a truth propoſed to <hi>Peters</hi> faith, that himſelf is juſtified. Let it be expreſſed then in the Syllogiſme, and it runs thus. He that beleeves all the objects of his faith, and particularly that himſelfe is juſtified,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116045:54"/> he is juſtified. But (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) I beleeve all the objects of my faith, and particularly that my ſelf am juſtified. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I am juſtified. If the Concluſion be here <hi>de ſide,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> beleeves he is juſtified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believes he is juſtified: which Concluſion (I confeſſe) is no act of reaſon. Nevertheleſſe, if Reaſon be yielded, to be <hi>principium aſſentiendi,</hi> the principle of aſſenting to the Concluſion, there will be better ſenſe in his Argumentation: namely, that <hi>Peter</hi> knows that he is juſtified, or is perſwaded thereof with a certainty of Reaſon, becauſe he beleeves it with a divine Faith: and that he could not do, if he were not juſtified.</p>
                  <p>As to the Syllogiſme which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> propoſeth for Illuſtration,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>All men ſhall riſe again.</hi> I am a man. <hi>Ergo,</hi> I ſhall riſe again. The Concluſion is partly of faith, and partly of reaſon. Of reaſon <hi>formaliter &amp; elicitivè:</hi> of faith <hi>fundamentaliter &amp; imperativè,</hi> (as I may ſo ſpeak) it being a particular knowledge grounded in a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of faith: for I could not have this knowledge, unleſſe I did by faith aſſent to the Propoſition. But that it is not purely of faith, I thus prove. If a man be ſound in the faith of the Reſurrection, that believes all men ſhall riſe, though he do not believe that himſelf ſhall riſe; then to aſſent that himſelf ſhall riſe, is not purely an act of faith. Becauſe a man cannot at the ſame time be ſound and unſound in the faith of the ſame article. But he is ſound in the faith of the Reſurrection that believes all men ſhall riſe, though he do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that himſelf ſhall riſe; for he believes as much as the Scripture reports. If it be ſaid, that a man cannot aſſent to the one, but he muſt aſſent to the other. I think ſo too. But the ground of it is, becauſe it is againſt reaſon, not becauſe it is againſt faith: and therefore the Concluſion is partly of reaſon, not purely of faith: which was that I was to demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion is; there can be no way imagined, in which faith may be ſaid to evidence our Juſtification, but one of thoſe three men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> propoſeth a fourth: but we have ſhewed, that it muſt be reduced to one of theſe three, and ſo differs in name only, not in thing). But we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its evidencing our Juſtification either of theſe wayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith muſt be ſaid to juſtifie in ſome other reſpect, then that it doth evidence Juſtification: or elſe we cannot be ſaid to be juſtified by faith at all.</p>

                  <p>MY third Argument comes next in place. That Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> of the phraſe, which makes us, at leaſt concurrent cauſes with God in the formal act of our own Juſtification, is not true. The Reaſon is, becauſe our Juſtification by faith, in regard of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal act of pronouncing us juſt, is in Scripture attributed wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. and 4. 6, 8. But to interpret our Juſtification by faith, meerly for a Juſtification in our own conſciences, is to make us at leaſt concurrent cauſes with God, in the formal act of our own Juſtification. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> before he anſwers the Argument, reformes my expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſayes, <q>That he doth not ſay that Juſtification by faith is meerly a Juſtification in conſcience: faith is ſometimes put objectively for Chriſt, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Whether meerly or not meerly, is an impertinent quarrel: he doth it too frequently; and to thoſe moſt eminent texts mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before in my third Chapter, which ſpeak of Gods juſtifying ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, he anſwers <hi>meerly</hi> ſo. And as for his putting of faith objectively for Chriſt, we have already ſhewed at large what injury it offers to the plain and pure Word of God. But I muſt tell him, it is moſt intolerable dealing, to build ſo large a diſcourſe, as is the greateſt part of his book, upon two Supporters which have no place in Scripture to ſet their feet on. The one is, when he pleaſeth to interpret Juſtification for the manifeſtation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The other, when he pleaſeth to put faith for its object, Chriſt. When ſuch a weight is laid upon theſe foundations, had it not been neceſſary to ſhew us the places, to clear and vindicate them, where theſe words muſt have this ſenſe and no other? But to the anſwer: (for this is nothing but a delay.) This it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The pronouncing of us juſt, is not the formal act of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but the imputing of righteouſneſſe, which is the Act of God alone: Miniſters may pronounce us juſt, without robbery done to God. So doth faith declare to our conſciences the ſentence of abſolution, &amp;c.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Argument is wholly yielded, and the ſinner thereby<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> made his own Juſtifier. 1. Let the formal act of Juſtification conſiſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:116045:55"/> in what it will, it matters not much in the preſent caſe. The Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which in Scripture is ſaid to be by faith, is wholly and only aſcribed unto God as the Juſtifier, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 30. and 4. 6, 8. and 1. 17. and 3. 22, 24, 25. and 8. 33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. and all the places that ſpeak of Juſtification by faith: which all ſuppoſe it to be Gods peculiar Royalty, to juſtifie us through faith; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be interpreted of Juſtification in our own conſciences, that is, of our juſtifying our ſelves, without ſetting up our ſelves in the Throne of God. Is this the man that reproacheth me in the face of the world, as a friend to Papiſts, for maintaining faith to be the condition of Juſtification, becauſe he thinks it will follow thence, that men may be ſaid to juſtifie themſelves? But I ſee, one may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſteal a horſe, then another look over the hedge. 2. My expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods pronouncing us juſt, I acknowledge to be a little too narrow, as moſt properly denoting that Juſtification which is by ſentence at the day of judgement: but I do therein alſo include <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificationem juris,</hi> the act of God by the Law of grace, that is, the Promiſe of the Goſpel, giving us right to impunity and eternal life for the ſake of Chriſt. And this is <hi>formaliſſimè,</hi> the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe. The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to believers in their Juſtification, inaſmuch as that for his merits they are reputed juſt before God, ſaith <note n="r" place="margin">Medul theol. l. 1. c. 27 theſ 12.</note> Dr. <hi>Ames.</hi> Now that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is in Scriptures ſaid to be by faith, is formally an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteouſneſſes and a non-imputation of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, 5. compared with <hi>ver. 6. 11, 24. Ergo,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, it is only Gods act, and no creature can be joyned with him therein, without robbery done to him. But we do joyne with him by faith, in imputing righteouſneſſe to our ſelves, if imputing righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to believers, be their knowing by faith, that righteouſneſſe is imputed to them, as we heard Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> interpreting it before, in anſwer to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                  <p>3. If there be any ſenſe wherein Miniſters may be ſaid to juſtifie<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> ſinners, yet it cannot be in that ſenſe wherein God is ſaid to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them that beleeve, for that is an act proper to himſelf.

Yet was it not they, but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116045:55"/> the Word which they preached, which did juſtifie or condemn: and that alſo received all its efficacy immediately from God. So that remiſſion of ſins is aſcribed to the Apoſtles, but as moral inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Such as they alſo were in raiſing the dead, healing the ſick, converting of ſinners, and the like. All which works were wrought immediately by God himſelf, <hi>immediatione virtutis,</hi> without any contribution of vertue or efficacy from man. But when we are ſaid to be juſtified by faith, if the meaning be, that by faith we know our ſelves to be juſtified: in this caſe, faith hath a true, proper, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and real efficiency in our Juſtification. And it is every whit as proper, yea, and more proper, to ſay we know by faith that we are juſtified, then to ſay, we know by God that we are juſtified: the former expreſſing the effect from its relation to its particular cauſe; the latter, to the univerſal. I cannot ſee, unleſſe God give me an eye, and concurre with it in the act of ſeeing, yet is it more proper to ſay I ſee, then that God ſees; ſo neither can I know that I am ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, unleſſe God give me faith, and concurre with the act of it, to diſcover it to me; yet am I more properly ſaid to juſtifie my ſelf, then God to juſtifie me, if by my Juſtification be meant my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I am juſtified.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> granteth faith to be the inſtrumental cauſe<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> of our knowing our ſelves to be juſtified, I ſee not how it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his Divinity. It is a principle with him, (as we ſhall ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) that no act of Gods can be an act of free grace, which hath any cauſe in the creature. But to manifeſt to me that I am juſtified is an act of free grace. <hi>Ergo,</hi> my faith cannot be the cauſe of it, no, not inſtrumentally. The Aſſumption is proved from all the places mentioned in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. to prove that we are juſtified by faith. All which ſpeak of Juſtification by free grace: and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> interprets every one of them of the manifeſtation of Juſtification. And now we ſhould diſpute the great Queſtion, Whether faith be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification? But becauſe there is one, and but one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more, proving that Juſtification by faith cannot be underſtood of the manifeſtation or knowledge thereof, I ſhall firſt make good my ground there, and then try out the other by it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>MY laſt Argument therefore was this. If Juſtification by faith<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> muſt be underſtood of Juſtification in our conſciences, then is not the word Juſtification taken properly, for Juſtification before God in all the Scriptures; for the Scriptures ſpeak of no Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by faith or works; the latter of which is Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and the former in our conſciences, according to Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. §. 10, 11, 12. and his anſwer is, 1. <hi>That Juſtification in conſcience, is Juſtification before God.</hi> Yet himſelf told us <note place="margin">Page 61.</note> before, that the <hi>ſight of God,</hi> in this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may not be underſtood of Gods making it, as it were, evident to our ſight, that we are juſtified: for then the diſtinction of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>in foro Dei &amp; in foro conſcientiae,</hi> would be a meer tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſaith he, <q>If faith be taken metonymically, then Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith is Juſtification before God: for it is a Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the merits of Chriſt, to whom alone, without works or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions performed by us, the Holy Ghoſt aſcribes our Juſtification in the ſight of God, <hi>Rom. 3. 24.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I deny, that faith is any where in Scripture put for Chriſt, in the Argument of Juſtification, though it include him as its object, whether his name be mentioned or no. <hi>In univerſalibus latet dolus.</hi> Give us ſome particular place or places, where the word muſt be neceſſarily ſo underſtood, and we will beleeve it. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. ſpeaks not of any Juſtification by Chriſt without faith: but moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely and ſyllabically of Juſtification by Chriſt through faith, <hi>ver. 25. whom God hath ſet forth to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> And that faith here cannot be taken objectively, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved. Yet if it had not been mentioned, it will by no means follow that it muſt be excluded: ſeeing there are multitudes of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſides where it is mentioned. The ſame I ſay to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. That the remiſſion of ſins there ſpoken of is by faith; for the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, <hi>that we have remiſſion of ſins, through the blood of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of the grace of God,</hi> he ſhewes the way in which grace communicates this bleſſing <hi>both to Jew and Gentile;</hi> namely, by the efficacy of the bleſſed Goſpel, calling them both to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116045:56"/> one and the ſame faith, and thereby to a common intereſt in the ſame bleſſings, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. though theſe bleſſings be given to the Jew firſt, and afterward to the Gentile, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. and therefore <hi>Paul Bayne</hi> obſerves from <hi>ver. 8. That God giveth pardon of ſins to none, to whom he hath not firſt given wiſdome and underſtanding, that is, whom he hath not taught to know and beleeve on his Chriſt.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, if faith had not been here mentioned, it muſt yet needs have been ſuppoſed: becauſe the Apoſtle writes to thoſe <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as unto Saints and <hi>faithful</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>ver. 1. To whom as ſuch do all ſpiritual bleſſings belong,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>according to the purpoſe of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> ver. 4. So that hitherto we have no intelligence of any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God mentioned in Scripture, but by faith.</p>
                  <p>His third anſwer is by way of retortion upon that expreſſion of<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> mine, That the Antinomians may reade their eyes out before they produce us one text for it (namely, where there is any mention of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification before God but by faith) He retorts, <q>That I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a threefold Juſtification, and yet neither of them by faith, in my Sermon, <hi>page</hi> 23.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But I do not acknowledge, that either of them is properly and formally the Juſtification of a ſinner before God. Nor yet that either of them is called by the name of Juſtification in Scripture: but only that our Juſtification may be conſidered as purpoſed of God, merited by the death of Chriſt, and exemplified in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>2. He tells us, <q>That we have no plain text for many of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates: As, 1. That juſtification doth in no ſenſe precede the act of faith.</q> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows well enough, that this is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of his own, and that it is no part of the quarrel between him and me; as I obſerved, <hi>page</hi> 1. and in his very laſt words mentions three ſenſes, in which I yield Juſtification may be before faith. But we ſeek a text of Scripture, wherein the true, proper, formal Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſinner is made antecedent to faith. If there be any ſuch text, why is it not produced? if there be none, why is it not yielded? Our ſecond dictate is, That Chriſt purchaſed only a conditional, not an abſolute Juſtification for his Elect.</p>
                  <p>But where is this ſaid? or by whom? it is by vertue of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt that we are juſtified, when we have performed the condition of believing.</p>
                  <p>The third, that our Evangelical Righteouſneſſe by which we are iuſtified, is in our ſelves. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This refers to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whoſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116045:57"/> judgement Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> repreſents as odiouſly as he can. But he knowes Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath produced many Scriptures and reaſons for proof of it: which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould have anſwered, before he had complained for want of a text.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, that the tenour of the New Covenant is, <hi>If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> I am ſure, he knows, that many famous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants aſſert this as well as I, and we ſhall ſee proof ſufficient of it in due place: and of the laſt alſo, that none were to have any benefit by the death of Chriſt, till they beleeve.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> takes ſpecial notice of one paſſage in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> wherein I ſay, that neither Juſtification in conſcience, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, are of much worth in the Apoſtles judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. To this he gives a large anſwer, §. 11. which I am apt to think, he would have taken no notice of, but to acquaint the world with his good wiſhes concerning me. He refers me to ſome texts of Scripture, to learn what account the Apoſtle had of Juſtification before men, and in conſcience (though I cannot learn what account he had of the former, from any of the texts mentioned.) But be it what it will be, I give him this brief reply, That in compariſon of Juſtification before God, neither the one nor the other are much worth, (though they may be of ſome worth in theſe inferiour Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories) Not only children, but grown perſons (for ought I know) may be ſaved, without being juſtified of men, or of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. And I will never beleeve, that that Juſtification is worthy of thoſe many glorious commendations which are every where in Scripture given to Juſtification by faith, which one may live and die without, and yet be ſaved. Who will prove to me convincingly, that a Chriſtian may not live many years, and die at laſt in melancholy or madneſſe (under which diſtempers the judgement of men, or of conſcience, is not much valued) and yet be ſaved? or that a ſoul may not, for ſome grievous ſin, go with ſorrow and darkneſſe to the grave, and never ſee light, till it be carried up to him that dwelleth in light.</p>

As the reading of the book, or acceptance of a pardon amongſt men, is a condition without which an offendor is not pardoned.

That it pertaines to him that diſpoſeth of any thing, to propound upon what condition his will is that it be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of, or not diſpoſed of. 2. That the nature of a condition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts mainly in ſuſpending the actual obligation of the diſpoſer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the condition be performed. 3. That it is the will of him that makes the condition, which is the cauſe of the obligation that comes upon him when the condition is performed: of which we ſhall ſee more anon.</p>
                  <p>Now that faith is the condition upon which God hath ſuſpended<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> his actual donation of righteouſneſſe to a ſinner, is ſo plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, that I confeſſe, I cannot but wonder that men acquainted with the Scriptures, ſhould ſo much as queſtion it.

                     </note> Civilians and Moraliſts, as ſignes or notes of a condition: and ſcarcely one can I finde, which the Scripture doth not uſe ſomewhere or other, in deſcribing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and habitude of faith to our Juſtification. But I ſhall inſtance but in one or two. I begin with that <hi>Rom. 10. 6, 9. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, That if thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleeve in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> That ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here includes Juſtification, appears from the very next words, <hi>ver. 10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> And I appeal to common ſenſe, whether the particle <hi>If</hi> in this place be not a manifeſt ſigne of a condition upon which Juſtification is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, or whether it be poſſible for mortal men to invent any words, that can more plainly expreſſe the matter of a condition. Try it by compariſon with other Scriptures, <hi>Gen. 43. 4, 5. If thou wilt ſend our brother with us, we will go down; but if thou wilt not ſend him, we will not go down;</hi> and <hi>Gen. 34. 22. Only herein will the men conſent to us.—If every male amongſt us be circumciſed.</hi> Herein will they conſent <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, upon this condition will they conſent: as we render that word, 1 <hi>Sam 11. 2. on this condition will I make a Covenant with you.</hi> See <hi>Gen. 18. 26. 28, 30. Exod. 4. 23. Prov. 2. 1, 4. Jor.</hi> 18. 8, 10. and hundreds of other places. In all which the particle <hi>If</hi> is manifeſtly conditional: nor upon the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obſervation, which I have made in reading the Scriptures, am I able to eſpy ſo much as one place, wherein the ſaid particle hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other uſe, when it ſuppoſeth to any thing that is future, by vertue of a Promiſe. Indeed Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> did <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 6.</note> before mention two places,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116045:58"/> wherein he will have the particle <hi>If,</hi> not to propound the condition by which a benefit is obtained, but only to deſcribe the perſon to whom it belongs, <hi>viz. 2 Tim. 2. 21. If a man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour,</hi> and <hi>Heb. 3. 6. whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt our confidence unto the end.</hi> As to the former place, it ſhould have been proved, and not ſaid only, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>If</hi> is not a note of a condition; if to be a veſſel of honour be, to be glorified in heaven. Or if to be a veſſel of honour do ſignifie a man ſpecially and eminently ſerviceable unto God, ſanctified and meet for the Maſters uſe, and prepared unto every good work (as the Apoſtle in the ſame verſe expounds it) then the particle <hi>If</hi> is a note of more then a condition, even of a true proper cauſe, of an effect that follows naturally, and not by Promiſe: for the more a man purgeth himſelf from ſpiritual defilements and defilers, the more prepared and diſpoſed he muſt needs be to every ſpiritual employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. is nothing to the purpoſe, if the particle <hi>If</hi> be there granted to be meerly a deſcription of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; becauſe the conſequent part of the Propoſition is not promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, but ſimply affirmative.

                  </p>
                  <p>And that the words, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou beleeve with thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> cannot be a deſcription of the perſon meerly, I prove largely below, in a particular debate of that place. I have here only one word to ſpeak againſt it. Either it deſcribes the perſon from his faith, to ſignifie that as ſuch (that is, as a believer) he is the ſubject of Juſtification, and then faith muſt needs be antecedent to Juſtification: and if it be antecedent as an act required of us in point of-duty, to a bleſſing conſequent by vertue of a promiſe, then is it antecedent as a condition. Or it is a meer deſcription of the perſon, ſhewing, that that is the man that ſhall be juſtified: though
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116045:59"/> his faith have no order nor tendency to his Juſtification, but may as well follow after it as go before it. But 1. This cannot be current ſenſe, if Juſtification be either from eternity, or immediately in the death of Chriſt, or at any time before this deſcription be made: for example, Is it ſenſe to ſay, If thou be the man that doſt, or at any time ſhalt beleeve, thou ſhalt be elected, or Chriſt ſhall die for thee; when both election and the death of Chriſt are long ſince paſt? or if a man ſhould ſay, If thou ſhalt be glorified, thou ſhalt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, would not ſuch a ſpeech ſuppoſe, that the perſon to whom thoſe words are ſpoken, was as yet not juſtified? though the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not wont to ſpeak after this manner in any place. 2. Let us take ſome parallel place, and ſee how it will accord with it. As the words of Chriſt, to the father of the childe that was poſſeſt, <hi>Mark 9. 23. If thou canſt beleeve, all things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> Or the ſame words to his diſciples, <hi>Matth. 17. 20. If you have faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, nothing ſhall be unpoſſible unto you.</hi> If faith do here only deſcribe the perſon, and not propound the condition, then whether the father had at preſent believed or no, his childe muſt have been preſently healed notwithſtanding; ſuppoſing him to be a perſon that at any time ſhould believe: and whether the diſciples beleeve or no at preſent, all things are poſſible to them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, they being the perſons whoſe property it is to believe ſome time or other. But more of this hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Another note of a condition is the particle <hi>if not,</hi> or <hi>except:</hi> which<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> we finde alſo uſed in Scripture in this matter: for men are threatened, that they ſhall not be juſtified except they beleeve, <hi>John</hi> 8. 24. If you beleeve not, or except you believe, you ſhall die in your ſins: when men are threatened with damnation except they believe, are they threatened abſolutely, or conditionally? if the firſt, then all the men of the world ſhall be damned: for this is to be preached to all men, <hi>that if they believe not, they ſhall be damned.</hi> If conditionally, then faith is the condition of deliverance from damnation. And is not God to be thus underſtood in all his ſpeeches of like nature? <hi>Gen. 44. 23. Except your youngeſt Brother come down with you, you ſhall ſee my face no more.</hi> Joſh. 7. 12. <hi>Neither will I be with you any more, except you deſtroy the accurſed from amongſt you.</hi> Can the Sun ſhine more bright in the firmament, then it is clear from hence, that their deſtroying the accurſed from amongſt them, was a neceſſary condition of their enjoyment of Gods Preſence? <hi>Acts 27. 31. Except theſe abide in the ſhip, you cannot be ſaved.</hi> See alſo <hi>Luke</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:116045:59"/> 13. 3, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5, 22. and multitudes of other places. In all which the ſame particle is a note of a condition, unleſſe we ſhall have the modeſty, to think that the Scriptures were penned on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puzzle and confound our underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe texts of Scripture which promiſe remiſſion of ſins to<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> them that believe, prove the ſame thing particularly, <hi>Mark 16. 15, 16. Go preach the Goſpel to every creature. He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> and 6. 40. <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me, that whoſoever ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life,</hi> with many places of like nature.

This text (ſaith he) and others like it, do only ſhew who have the fruition and enjoyment of the benefits of Chriſt, to wit, They that beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch cathedral determinations we have from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> ſo much as a pretence to proof: eſpecially in his anſwers to Scriptures alledged againſt him; yet might he very well think that we would expect ſome ſolid reaſon for this his perpetual wreſting and abuſe of words from their obvious and common ſenſe. 1. It cannot indeed be denied, but that the ſame words which propoſe the condition upon which a benefit is obtained, may alſo <hi>conſequentèr</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the perſons to whom the ſaid benefit doth belong, but that ſuch manner of ſpeech as is uſed in theſe texts, doth only ſhew the perſons who, and not the condition or meanes by which a benefit is obtained, is contrary to the perpetual ſenſe of Scripture. Let us tranſcribe a few texts of many, <hi>Numb. 21. 8. And it ſhall come to paſſe, that overy one</hi> (or whoſoever) <hi>is bitten, when he looketh upon it,</hi> (namely upon the brazen Serpent) <hi>ſhall live.</hi> I do the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in theſe words, becauſe the Lord illuſtrateth the method of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by them, <hi>John 3. 14, 15. As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſſe, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, &amp;c.</hi> If the <hi>protaſis</hi> had been full, it had run thus. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lift up the Serpent in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that whoſoever looked on him might be healed: even ſo, &amp;c.</hi> And do thoſe words (<hi>that whoſoever looked on him</hi>) only deſcribe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was healed, but not propound the condition or meanes of healing? common ſenſe cannot endure it. Their looking up to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116045:60"/> the brazen Serpent was antecedent to their healing: and a meanes ordained for them to uſe, that they might be healed: and their heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by vertue of Gods power and faithfulneſſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was a condition of their healing. And the diſtributive particle <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,</hi> doth ſufficiently ſhew, that it was every one promiſcuouſly, one as well as another, for whoſe healing the Serpent was lifted up, through their looking on it; and not a note of diſtinction to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence one from another. So <hi>Mark 11. 23. Whoſoever ſhall ſay unto this mountain</hi> (believingly) <hi>Be thou removed, he ſhall have whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaith.</hi> Is this alſo a deſcription of the perſon, but not a propounding of the meanes by which thoſe works may be obtained to be wrought? ſee the like expreſſions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 12. and 16. 25. and 18. 4. <hi>Mark 9. 41. Rev.</hi> 22. 17. and other places without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. To all which, if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> can oppoſe but one that will admit ſuch a ſenſe, as here he puts upon the texts under debate, he ſhall do more then any Authour elſe that I can yet meet with. 2. If theſe and the like places do only deſcribe the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, then do they aſcribe no more to faith in reference to ſalvation, then unto works. Works of righteouſneſſe being as proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them that ſhall be ſaved; as faith it ſelfe: and therefore the deſcription of the perſon might as well be taken from them, as from faith. 3. That which ſerves only to deſcribe a perſon <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> cannot be propoſed to another perſon as a meanes by which he may enjoy a like benefit, no more then if the ſaid perſon had been deſcribed <hi>in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuo;</hi> for example, ſuppoſe the Lord had deſcribed them that ſhall be ſaved, not from faith, (their ſpecifick quality) but by their proper names, and had ſaid, God gave his Son to death, that <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John, &amp;c.</hi> might be ſaved: were it not againſt all ſenſe and ſobriety to go to <hi>Geofry, Roger</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> and tell them if they will be <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> they ſhall be ſaved? or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the deſcription had been from the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and the words had run thus, God gave his Son, that whoſoever is borne of Jewiſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhould be ſaved: were it not ridiculous, with all ſeriouſneſſe, earneſtneſſe and tenderneſſe of compaſſion, to exhort and beſeech, and charge the Gentiles to be borne of Jewiſh Parents, that they might be ſaved? yea, ſuppoſe they had been deſcribed from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, (as they might have been more properly then from their faith) had it not been abſurd to exhort men that they would be elected, that ſo they might be ſaved? I conclude therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the texts before us are not a deſcription of the perſon, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116045:60"/> of a condition, upon which only ſalvation is attainable, words that are meerly deſcriptory, can never be reſolved into a command or exhortation.</p>

                  <p>LEt us now ſee whether Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath done any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> a proofe, that faith is not the condition of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Reaſon is this, <q>That interpretation of the phraſe, which gives no more to faith in the buſineſſe of Juſtification, then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works of ſanctification, cannot be true. But to interpret Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith meerly thus, that faith is a condition to qualifie us for Juſtification, gives no more to faith, then to other works of Sanctification; as to repentance, charity, new obedience, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Propoſition be true, (as I believe it to be moſt true) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath hitherto deluded us groſſely in interpreting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith, for a knowledge or evidence that we are juſtified: ſeeing works concur to ſuch an evidence, (and that by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion) as was above demonſtrated. 2. The Aſſumption alſo (I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume) proceeds upon the ſuppoſed principles of thoſe whom he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, and not according to his own ſenſe: for I think, he will not ſay, that any works of Sanctification do qualifie us for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 3. I deny the Aſſumption. And how doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove it? Why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> ſay ſo. Yet are neither of theſe Authours of ſuch authority with Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> in other caſes, as that their word ſhould paſſe for a proof. And yet hath he not fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented them neither. Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> I confeſſe, is to me leſſe plain and intelligible: but if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will undertake that his notion is the ſame with Mr. <hi>Baxters,</hi> he might have ſeen in very many places of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> writings, that he makes works but the ſecondary leſſe principal conditions at moſt, and denies them to be any conditions at all, in reference to our firſt entrance into a ſtate of Juſtification. And muſt we yet believe againſt an Authours owne words, that he aſcribes no more to faith then unto other works of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, in the matter of Juſtification? 4. I alſo do make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a neceſſary condition of remiſſion of ſins, becauſe the Scripture doth ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. And that repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116045:61"/> of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and 3. 19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, &amp;c.</hi> But I conceive withal, that the one is included in the other, and that their difference is rather reſpective then real, if we ſpeak of faith as it is in the will; partly, as to the object, faith reſpecting Chriſt immediately, and repentance God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. partly, as to the termes: the ſame motion of the ſoule, in reſpect of the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> (namely, dead works) being called repentance: and in reſpect of the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> (namely God in Chriſt) more peculiarly faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance alſo in its formal notion, includes ſhame, and ſorrow, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abhorrency, &amp;c. which faith preciſely doth not. As to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this paragraph, which concernes my ſubſcription to the <hi>teſtimony to the truth of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (a book ſo called) I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ever I ſubſcribed it in this or any other County.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſecond Argument is this. To interpret Juſtification by faith,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> that faith is a neceſſary antecedent condition of Juſtification, gives no more to faith then to works of nature, as to ſight of ſin, legal ſorrow, &amp;c. for if theſe be conditions diſpoſing us to faith, and faith a condition, diſpoſing us to Juſtification, then are they alſo conditions diſpoſing us to Juſtification; for <hi>cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument at the long run overthrows all humane contracts: at leaſt, it fights as ſtrongly againſt them as againſt us. <hi>Titius</hi> gives a hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to <hi>Sempronius,</hi> upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diton he give two pence a week to <hi>Maevius.</hi> This two pence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paid, unleſſe the ſilver be digged out of the mines, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtamp't, and delivered out of the Coyners hand, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mpronius</hi> his giving two pence a week to <hi>Maevius,</hi> is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his holding his 100. li. <hi>per annum:</hi> at leaſt no more then the mine or bank is. Is not this gallant Logick? 2. I deny that legal ſorrows, and the ſight of ſin, &amp;c. are neceſſary conditions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to faith: becauſe God hath not promiſed to give faith, if we be convicted or legally ſorry. Theſe Preparations are neceſſary phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically, not morally: becauſe the ſoule cannot ſeek out for life and ſalvation in another, while it hath confidence of ſufficiency in its ſelfe. If any man beleeve without theſe, he ſhall be ſaved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. 3. The anſwer therefore is, that the things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>naturally,</hi> are not the conditions of gift, but thoſe only which are made neceſſary by the will of the Donour; <note n="h" place="margin">L. conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes eztrinſec. <hi>F. de cond. &amp; demonſtr.</hi>
                     </note> and ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116045:61"/> doth the Civil Law determine. <hi>Caius</hi> gives <hi>Seius</hi> all the fruits that grow upon his farme the next year: it is neceſſary that fruits grow upon the farme, or elſe <hi>Seius</hi> cannot have them: yet <hi>Caius</hi> his gift is not conditional, but abſolute. 4. As to that logical axiome. <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows it muſt have more limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then one, or elſe 'tis dangerouſly falſe. But in the preſent caſe 'tis altogether impertinent; for neither are legal preparations the cauſe of faith, nor faith the cauſe of Juſtification, but the condition only, and ſo the <hi>cauſa &amp; cauſatum</hi> may go whiſtle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The third Argument is this, that by which we are juſtified is the<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> proper, efficient, meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification. Faith as a condition is not ſo.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the <hi>major.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proves it by a threefold Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1. By the uſe of theſe Propoſitions (particles he would have ſaid) <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> in ordinary ſpeech, which note a meritorious or inſtrumental cauſe. As when we ſay, <q>A ſouldier was raiſed by his valour; a tradeſman lives by his trade. 2. From the contrary phraſe: as when the Apoſtle denies that a man is juſtified by works, and by the Law, he excludes works from any cauſal influxe into our Juſtification. Now that which he denies to works, he aſcribes to faith. 3. From other parallel phraſes in Scripture, where we are ſaid to be redeemed, juſtified and ſaved. <hi>Per Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, per ſanguinem, per mortem, per vulnera.</hi>
                     </q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are <note n="i" place="margin">De Juſtif. l. 1. c. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wiſe Arguments, to prove that faith doth juſtifie <hi>per modum cauſae, dignitatis aut meriti;</hi> by way of cauſality, worth or merit; which it ſeems Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> accounts unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, otherwiſe he would not have brought them again upon the ſtage in an Engliſh dreſſe, when our Proteſtants have beat them off ſo often in Latine. 1. To the firſt, I deny that the particles <hi>By</hi> or <hi>Through</hi> are alwayes the notes of a cauſe meritorious or inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. How many times do we finde them in one Chapter, where they are not capable of any ſuch ſignification? <hi>Heb. 11. 5. By faith E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> and <hi>ver. 11. Through faith Sarah received ſtrength to conceive ſeed,</hi> ver. 30. <hi>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down,</hi> ver. 33. <hi>By faith they ſtopped the mouthes of Lions,</hi> ver. 35. <hi>Women by faith received their dead raiſed to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> with many other paſſages in that Chapter. That it is the grace of faith which is here ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appears from the deſcription of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> grant the Papiſts, that faith was the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of theſe effects? I hope then he will no more reproach me
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116045:62"/> as popiſhly affected. It may be he will ſay it was the inſtrumental cauſe: But let him ſhew how. What inſtrumental efficacy did faith put forth in <hi>Enochs</hi> Tranſlation? did it either ſubtilize or immortallize his body? or how was faith an inſtrument in throwing down the walls of <hi>Jericho?</hi> It is naturally impoſſible <hi>agere in diſtans,</hi> to act upon an object which the Agent toucheth not, formally or virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: or what efficiency did faith put forth upon dead bodies, to raiſe them to life again? Theſe effects are no otherwiſe aſcribed to faith, then as the condition upon which they were wrought, and without which they could not have been wrought, according to Gods ordination. As it is ſaid concerning the Lord Jeſus, That <hi>he could not do many mighty works in his own countrey, becauſe of their unbelief,</hi> Mark 6. 5, 6. with Matth. 13. 58. Not that their faith had contributed any thing to his ability: but that their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by vertue of Gods ordination, made them uncapable of being the ſubjects, for and amongſt whom thoſe works were to be wrought.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond, I deny that Juſtification is aſcribed to faith in the<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> ſame ſenſe, in which it is denied to works, though it be the ſame Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as to its common nature, which is aſcribed to that, and denied to theſe: and therefore cannot be meant of a Juſtification manifeſted to conſcience, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> interprets it, when he comes to particular places. 'Tis confeſſed, that when the Apoſtle denies that a man is juſtified by works, he excludes works from any cauſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux into our Juſtification. But it will by no means follow, that when he aſcribes it to faith, he doth therefore acknowledge faith to be a cauſe. No more then the like oppoſition in Scripture doth denote the ſame kinde of cauſe on both ſides, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A double Argument Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> preſents us with for proof. 1. <q>We ſhould not be Juſtified freely by his grace, if any condition were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us in order to our Juſtification: for a condition, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is performed, makes the thing covenanted a due debt, which the Promiſer is bound to give: and then Juſtification ſhould not be of grace, but of debt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gladly am I come to this objection: and I ſhall give it a large anſwer, not for any ſtrength there is in it; but becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> pretends in his title-page, and the inſcription of his book throughout, to oppoſe the ancient Proteſtant doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith, upon the quarrel of free grace. And it is upon the point the total ſumme of all he hath to ſay for his neoterick notion: but they may be taken with words that will.</p>
                  <p>The place which he alludes to in the objection is, <hi>Rom. 3 24. Being juſtified freely by his grace.</hi> But which of theſe two words is it that excludes conditions? <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, we ſhall now caſt Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> into forme, and turne it going.</p>
                  <p>If faith be the condition of our Juſtification, then upon our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we are juſtified of debt, not of grace. The reaſon is, becauſe what is promiſed upon condition, the condition being performed becomes a due debt. But the conſequence is falſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the antecedent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the Propoſition I anſwer, 1. In general, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf denies it, when he thought it might be for his advantage, <hi>pag. 190.</hi> No man (ſaith he) will ſay, that the condition required of <hi>Adam,</hi> was meritorious of eternal life in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe: And yet urgeth here, that if faith be the condition, Juſtification muſt needs be of debt. 2. I diſtinguiſh, if the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be, that Juſtification becomes due in that larger ſenſe, which we ſpake of but now, if faith be the condition of it, then I grant it. But if the meaning be (as I believe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> intends, by quoting <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4.) that it becomes due in juſtice, then I deny it. And what's the proof? why, a condition performed makes the thing promiſed a due debt. The ſubſtance of this axiome I meet with, I think, not leſſe then twenty times in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> book, but no where elſe in all the books I have, Civilians or Canoniſts. And as often as 'tis uſed, he doth not once attempt to prove it, but leaves it naked to the world to ſhift for it ſelfe. Conditions are either cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſuch as have proportion of worth to the benefit promiſed: and theſe being performed, make the thing promiſed a due debt. As when I promiſe my ſervant five pounds, if he will ſerve me for ſuch a terme of time. Some be meerly illative or diſpoſitive: as when I promiſe a man to give him twenty pounds, if he will come and fetch it. And theſe conditions (of which kinde is faith,) do not make the reward due in juſtice: which I thus prove.</p>
                  <p>Where there is not <hi>aequalitas dati &amp; accepti,</hi> an equality between<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> the thing received and promiſed, there can be no obligation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. But it is ſuppoſed, that between theſe conditions and the things promiſed there is no equality. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I ſuppoſe it will be ſaid, that though the things of themſelves be not equal, yet they are made
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116045:64"/> equal by the promiſe or contract, the condition being performed. To which I anſwer, that it is impoſſible. Indeed I think the Civil Law allowes an action upon ſuch promiſes, when the condition is performed (<note n="z" place="margin">Vide Vigel. de Dreyſ. Jnſt. Jur. l. 3. c. 8. &amp; Weſſemb. para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit. D l. 50. tit. 12.</note> and ſo it doth alſo in ſome caſes, upon the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe) but we enquire not what is juſt <hi>juſtitiâ civili,</hi> but what is juſt <hi>juſtitiâ naturali.</hi> And I ſay again, that a work, which hath of it ſelfe no proportion to ſuch or ſuch a reward, receives no increaſe of worth by the Promiſe, that ſettles ſuch a reward upon it, or by being made the condition of ſuch a Promiſe. If it doth, then the value of the work is to be meaſured by the reward that is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to it, and ſo the mercy and liberality of the Promiſer excludes his mercy and grace in fulfilling his Promiſe. For if the Promiſe make the condition equal to the reward, then in fulfilling his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he doth but <hi>aequalia aequalibus rependere,</hi> proportion the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the worth of the action, and ſo cannot exerciſe grace and liberality in performing his Promiſe; for example, A King promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a condemned Traitour, that if he will but acknowledge his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and accept of his royal favour, he will not only give him his life, but advance him to ſuch honour, wealth and power, as ſhall make him the ſecond man in the Kingdome, yea, and leave him his ſucceſſour in the Throne: That ſuch a Promiſe is of ſpecial grace and favour, he is not a reaſonable creature that ſhall deny; but if the Traitours acknowledgement and acceptance of the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by being made the condition of his deliverance and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, become forthwith proportionable thereunto, then is it no mercy nor grace in the King, to beſtow theſe favours upon him. Yea, the ſame work will be of more and leſſe value. Suppoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Traitour upon the ſame condition be promiſed his life, and no more. In the former, it is of a great deal more worth and value then in this, becauſe proportionable to a greater reward. Yea, and it will be impoſſible that there ſhould be any cheating in buying and ſelling, or any other contract, if things of themſelves unequal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forthwith equal, by vertue of a contract. Suppoſe a man give a great price for a Jewel, and the Jewel prove counterfeit: yet by vertue of the contract, it becomes equal to the price he gave for it, and the buyer may not complain of the injuſtice of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage.

                  <p>Here it may be demanded, whether works in the firſt Covenant,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> were proportionable to the reward promiſed? which, with ſome
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116045:65"/> limitations, I ſhall anſwer affirmatively. But becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gives me here no occaſion to ſpeak to it, but urgeth it ſtrongly in another place, the Reader muſt have patience till he come thither. In the mean time let us ſee whether it cannot be proved, that a gift may be given of grace, and yet upon condition. 1. I put this caſe, <hi>Philemon</hi> promiſeth <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> upon condition he will acknowledge, that he neither hath, nor can merit any good of him, but rather that for his thievery and ſeveral other injuries which he hath done him, he hath deſerved to be quite caſt out of his favour, that he will forgive former injuries, and moreover make him heire of all he hath. That he may give it upon ſuch a condition is unqueſtionable, for a man may make what he will the condition of his owu gift. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas regit conditiones,</hi> ſaith the <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionib. <hi>F. de Cond &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtr.</hi>
                     </note> Law. <hi>Oneſimus</hi> accepts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the condition. I do ask, whether he do thereby merit his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters favour and eſtate, or no? If not, the queſtion is yielded: if ſo, then contradictions and impoſſibilities may be true. For he confeſſeth, that he neither hath nor can merit any thing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: and yet in ſo ſaying, he doth merit, even all his Maſter is worth. Now faith is a condition of like nature: as being an act of ſelf-dereliction, a kinde of holy deſpaire, a renouncing of all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in our ſelves, as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>page</hi> 76. and this doth the Lord require as the condition of our partaking in his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, <hi>Jer. 3. 12, 13. I am merciful ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep anger for ever: only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us ſearch the Scriptures. <hi>Jer. 18. 7, 8. At what inſtant I</hi>

Jonah</hi> 3. 4. In the former place, God gives us a general rule to underſtand his threatenings, as having a tacite condition of repentance, by which the evil threatened may be eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Otherwiſe <hi>Janas</hi> had ſpoken falſe in the Name of the Lord, in threatening deſtruction to <hi>Nineveh</hi> within fourty dayes: for the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not then deſtroyed; but upon their repentance, what the Lord promiſed in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> he performed upon them, <hi>Jon. 3. 10. God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it

                     <note n="c" place="margin">Vide Krake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitz. in loc. p. 341.</note> Repentance then (if God be a God of truth, and cannot lie) is the condition of our deliverance from threatened evils: ſuitable to that of our Lord, <hi>Luke 13. 3. Except you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Yet Gods ſaving men (<hi>Nineveh</hi> in particular) upon their repentance, is an act of his grace, not of their merit: and unto that grace of God doth <hi>Jonah</hi> aſcribe it, <hi>Jon. 4. 2. I knew that thou art a gracious God and merciful.</hi> In like manner is <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance from the judgements threatened, aſcribed to the free grace and mercy of God, as the only cauſe: though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own repentance and returning unto God as the condition thereof, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. So 2 <hi>Chron. 30. 19.

Indeed the word <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>gracious,</hi> is not expreſſely mentioned in this text; but mercy is, which is tantamount to it: and likely they go both together, as before, <hi>Jonah 4. 2.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116045:66"/> cauſes with the merits of Chriſt in procuring our Juſtification; for the merits of Chriſt are not a phyſical, but a moral cauſe. Now by aſcribing to faith a moral cauſal influxe in our Juſtification, we do clearly put it <hi>in eodem genere cauſae</hi> with the blood of Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The merits of Chriſt do not concur in our Juſtification, as any part of that formal act by which we are juſtified. It is God as Supreme Lawgiver, and Judge, and Chriſt as King under him who is our Juſtifier. The merits of Chriſt are a cauſe of themſelves, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to put forth that act. 2. I would ask Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> whether the death of Chriſt be no more then a condition without which we are not juſtified? if it be, he doth ill to talke of my putting faith in the ſame kinde of cauſe with Chriſts death: for I aſcribe no more to faith, then that it is a condition, without which not. If it be not, Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> I doubt, will be found guilty of degrading the blood of Chriſt, more then I of advancing faith beyond its due place. 3. By faith we concur to our own Juſtification, not cauſally, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, <hi>&amp; terminativè;</hi> as the earth concurs to my going, as the thing I walk upon: a viſible object to my ſight, as the thing ſeen: and other objects to the acts that are converſant about them. 4. And the Argument at laſt begs the queſtion: for it ſuppoſeth that we aſcribe to faith a cauſal influxe into our Juſtification, which is the thing I diſpute againſt.</p>

                  <p>THe fifth Argument ſucceeds. <q>That interpretation of this<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> phraſe, which makes works going before Juſtification, not only not ſinſul, but acceptable to God, and preparatory to the grace of Juſtification, is not according to the minde of the Holy Ghoſt. But to interpret Juſtification by faith, that faith is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition qualifying us for Juſtification, doth ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The tree muſt be good, or elſe the fruit cannot be good, <hi>Luke 6. 43, 44.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116045:66"/> 
                     <hi>Eyre</hi> mentioneth, as <note n="e" place="margin">

                     <hi>Auguſtine, &amp;c.</hi> Take works as they are oppoſed to faith, whereof the words quoted are an uncontrollable evidence. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had ſhewed us, that his legion of Orthodox Writers did as much oppoſe the antecedency of faith as of works to Juſtification, he had ſpoken to purpoſe. The tree indeed muſt be good before the fruit can be good. But the tree is made good by faith, and the Spirit of Sanctification, which is the good treaſure of the heart, which bringeth forth good works, <hi>Luke 6. 45. John</hi> 15. 5. I never heard before, that Juſtification (which is a grace without us) was the roote and inward principle, of good actions.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and laſt Argument is this, <q>To ſay that faith is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> condition, that doth morally qualifie us for Juſtification, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proves it thus. <q>
                        <hi>To be both active and paſſive in reference to the ſame effect, is a flat contradiction</hi> (and yet this alſo ſhould be delivered with a little more caution: a Chriſtian is both active and paſſive in all the good works he doth, but I ſtand not on it.) A condition is a moral efficient cauſe of that which is promiſed upon condition, in the uſe of the Juriſts: though in the logical no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, it hath not the leaſt efficiency.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And why may not we be permitted to uſe it in its logical notion? the moſt logical ſenſe is the moſt rational. And ſeeing Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> confeſſeth, that in its logical notion, a condition hath not the leaſt efficiency; he muſt give me leave to account his Argument illogical, that is, irrational, that proceeds upon ſuppoſition of the contrary. 2.

Or if he give him the ſame ſumme with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if he die before the age of twenty one, then it ſhall come to <hi>Caius</hi> his younger brother. That an accidental effect ſhould be a meritorious cauſe is not imaginable. 4. The caſe is the ſame again in all arbitrary or voluntary conditions, (If they be meerly ſuch, and have nothing beyond the nature of a condition added or concurring) for the diſtribution of conditions, <hi>in caſuales &amp; pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtativas,</hi> is not <hi>generis in ſpecies,</hi> but <hi>ſubjecti in adjuncta:</hi> for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is one and the ſame in its nature and uſe, whether the act or event which is made the condition, be meerly caſual or voluntary. And therefore when Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, that if a man do any thing for obtaining a benefit, he is active in procuring it, if he mean phyſically, I grant it; if morally, I deny it: becauſe a voluntary act, when it is a condition, contributes no more to the obtaining of a benefit, then a contingent act, being alſo a condition: and yet by ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual condition doth a man obtain a benefit, and yet acts nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it.</p>
                  <p>Let us, for clearing and concluding this diſpute, again reſume the<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> inſtance given before. <hi>Philemon</hi> promiſeth <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> that if he will confeſſe his fault, he will pardon him, and give him his whole e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: which condition <hi>Oneſimus</hi> performes. I ask now, whether his performance of this condition be the cauſe of his pardon, and of the gift promiſed him. If not, then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> muſt confeſſe this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be nothing: if ſo, then let us know plainly what cauſe it is: (for Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> holds me altogether in generals, and determines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one ſyllable of proof, that it is a cauſe, but tells me not what cauſe it is, nor what its cauſality). Is it a meritorious cauſe? That cannot be: becauſe there is nothing in his confeſſion, that can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile the greatneſſe of the injury, or hold proportion with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; or doth it move meerly objectively? as we ſay poverty moves a liberal man, and miſery a merciful man? But this is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called a <hi>motive cauſe,</hi> being indeed no cauſe at all, but the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency or moral capacity of a perſon, to be the object of an act of mercy or liberality: otherwiſe, by how much the greater mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is, by ſo much the leſſe praiſe-worthy is Gods mercy in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us: becauſe, by how many the more cauſes concur to an effect, by ſo much the leſſe praiſe is due to each. That faith moves in this manner, I will not deny, but this will not make it a cauſe, at leaſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116045:67"/> no other then <hi>à cauſa ſine qua non:</hi> and how a meer condition (ſuch as in the inſtance given ſhould be any other) I cannot conceive. Briefly, if the condition aforeſaid, performed by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> be the cauſe of his Maſters gift, then either of the Promiſe, or of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. But the ſaid condition is neither the cauſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor of fulfilling it. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Not of the Promiſe; for <hi>Philemons</hi> will is the cauſe of the condition: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the condition is not the cauſe of <hi>Philemons</hi> will ſignified in his Promiſe: for the effect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe of its cauſe. A condition as ſuch, cannot move the Donour to promiſe, becauſe it is his will, and nothing elſe, that makes it a condition, (though I deny not, but there may be ſomething in the condition, which may move the will <hi>quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> that is, encline it to pitch upon this rather then that: or to make this the condition rather then that) Not of the performance of the Promiſe, for the ſame reaſon: for it is moſt abſurd, that the will ſhould make its own motive cauſes. As if we ſhould ſuppoſe <hi>Philemon</hi> ſaying thus, I will make his confeſſion the condition of my gift, and then I will be moved by it to beſtow it upon him. If there be not attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive vertue enough, (as I may ſo call it) in the condition, till the will reſolve to be moved by it, then ſurely the motion of the will is from it ſelfe, not from it. Wherefore the cauſe, both of the Promiſe and Performance, is <hi>Philemons</hi> good will, who of his own accord obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf to give ſuch a gift, ſuch a condition being performed, and will not be obliged without it: if he would, he might give it preſently without any condition: but as it is his will, that the Donee ſhall be uncapable of receiving any benefit by him, unleſſe ſuch a thing be done; ſo is it his will which makes him capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it when it is done.</p>

That we performe the condition is from the grace of God, no leſſe then the bleſſings we partake in upon performance of it: and therefore the praiſe of all is due to him only. Yet the grace is greater in giving the latter then the former, by how much the end is better then the meanes. And if the welch man did indeed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116045:68"/> think, that he was more beholding to his reading, then to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of his Prince, for his life: his Logick was as ridiculous as his language; for though the Law would not have ſaved him without his reading, (and much leſſe would his reading have ſaved him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that favourable Law) yet his life is a thouſand fold more worth then his reading of two or three lines: and therefore he owes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more thanks to his Prince, for giving him his life upon ſuch a condition, then to himſelf for reading, ſuppoſing his reading to have been the purchaſe of his life. If a man ſell a farme to his friend for five hundred, for which another would have given him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: what more common then to ſay, He hath given his friend five hundred in the buying?</p>
                  <p>3. But in ſober ſadneſſe, doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> think the welch man ſpeaks<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> properly, in his God bleſſe her father, &amp;c?

                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:116045:69"/>
                  <p>In that which followes I finde nothing which is not anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> or muſt not be anſwered in due place: for whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, <hi>that the performance of the condition makes the conditional grant to become abſolute;</hi> the words are ambiguous. If he mean, it makes it abſolute, as that without which it had never been abſolute, I grant it: if he mean, it makes it abſolute by contributing any direct cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, I deny it; for upon performance of the condition, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional grant doth indeed become abſolute, not by the worth or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the condition, but by the will of the Promiſer, that upon the exiſtence of ſuch a thing or action, will be obliged, and not without it. We have already given ſeveral inſtances of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have nothing of worth in them to engage the Donour, and therefore cannot be the cauſe of the gift: for nothing can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effect more noble and excellent then it ſelfe. Nor doth it receive any addition of intrinſecal worth, by being made the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: otherwiſe we might work as rare feats by the influence of our wills, as <note n="l" place="margin">Magnet. cure of wounds.</note> 
                     <hi>Van Helmont</hi> thinks may be wrought by the magick of the fancie. 'Tis but willing a pin to be worth a pound, and it ſhall be done.</p>
                  <p>And when he addes in the next place, that if faith be the condition of the New Covenant in ſuch a ſenſe, as perfect obedience was the condition of the old, man muſt needs be his own Juſtifier: if he mean <hi>ſuch</hi> in the matter and particular nature of the condition. It is true, if he mean <hi>ſuch</hi> in the common nature of a condition, it is falſe: for we have ſhewed before, both from Reaſon and Scripture, Divines and Lawyers, that ſome kinde of conditions are ſo far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with grace, as that they advance it rather. As ſuppoſe ſome benefit of very great value be beſtowed on a worthleſſe perſon, upon condition that he acknowledge the rich, ſuperlative grace and love of the Donour to be the only cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Finally, thus he ſpeaks. <q>As in the old Covenant, it was not Gods threat that brought death upon the world, juſt ſo in the New (if it be a conditional Promiſe,) it is not the Promiſe that juſtifies a beleever, but the beleever himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The anſwer is ready. <hi>Death came into the world by ſin,</hi> as the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable meritorious cauſe, but ſin could not have ſlain us but by the Law, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56. Rom. 5. 13, 14. Ergo.</hi> It is not wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that Gods threat did not bring death upon the world. 2. And when Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath proved that our performance of the Goſpel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions hath the ſame proportion to our ſalvation, as ſin hath to our
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116045:69"/> deſtruction, the Papiſts ſhall thank him, <hi>Rom. 6. laſt. The wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Mens not-accepting of the grace of God, may make that grace without effect as to themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 1. Rom.</hi> 3. 3. But that therefore their acceptance is the cauſe of Gods being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, is wilde reaſoning. And as to worthy Dr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> (out of whom Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> quotes theſe paſſages,) he hath publickly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, (and in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> hearing for one) declared himſelf to be no enemy againſt conditions of Juſtification or ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>That he that is pardoned upon his reading, doth not pardon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> I proved thus: becauſe then he muſt concurre either to the making of the Law, which gives pardon upon ſuch a condition; or to the pronouncing of the ſentence of abſolution upon himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This (Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaith) is an impertinent anſwer; becauſe the queſtion is not, whether a man did concur in making the Law and Rule of his Juſtification, but whether he had any cauſal influxe in producing the effect thereof.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> My anſwer (if he will call it ſo) was very pertinent as to the caſe of an offendor ſaved by his Clergy, whoſe pardon is perfected by a Law (which gives the remote right) and ſentence paſſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Law (which produceth his immunity it ſelfe.) If then the ſaid offendor cauſe his own pardon; it muſt be by concurring ſome way or other to the production of one of theſe. The caſe is altogether the ſame in our juſtification before God; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Law of grace, and in ſentence paſſed according to that Law: which becauſe we muſt purpoſely prove by and by, I ſhall here ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede for a while.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I added for illuſtration in theſe words. It is God<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> that glorifies us, and not we our ſelves; yet ſurely God doth not glorifie us before we beleeve.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer conſiſts of two parts: the one is a conceſſion of what I ſay, with an explanation how glory is called a reward: and ſayes, <q>That a reward is for a work two wayes: 1. When a work is proportionable to the wages. 2. When it is not anſwerable to the wages, yet is due by Promiſe; as when a poor man hath twenty ſhillings for an houres labour:</q> though the work be not worth it, yet it is a due debt, and he may challenge it as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Againſt which I have not much to oppoſe: yet if the houres
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116045:70"/> work, neither in reſpect to its ſelfe, nor any circumſtance that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, as the Art, Danger, Detriment of the Labourer, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, pleaſure, profit, &amp;c. of him for whom he labours (all which corne into the <note n="m" place="margin">Leſſ. de juſt. &amp; jured. 2 c. 18. d. 3.</note> value of the work) deſerve the ſaid twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, then is the reward, though partly of debt, <hi>quia &amp; operanti aliquid abeſt,</hi> becauſe the workman puts himſelf to expence of time and ſtrength; and he for whom he worketh hath the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof: yet is it alſo of grace, <note n="n" place="margin">Azor. Inſiit. Mor. p 3. l. 11. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>quatenus excedit meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> inaſmuch as it exceeds the value of the work. And that the Labourer may challenge it, ariſeth from civil, not from natural juſtice. But I readily grant, that glory is not our reward in this ſenſe. But how then is it a reward?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Becauſe it comes after, and in the place of the work,</q> ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Of which I ſhall ſpeak more hereafter: for the preſent, what is ſaid ſufficeth me, <hi>viz.</hi> That the reward follows the act, whereof it is the reward: for hence it follows, that if Juſtification be given as the reward of faith, then muſt it needs follow faith. But we have proved before, that Juſtification (even the imputation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) is the gracious reward of faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to it.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond anſwer is this, <q>Though the bleſſings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be given us freely, and not upon conditions performed by us, yet God hath his order in beſtowing them: firſt, he gives grace imputed, and then inherent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> My Argument is <hi>à pari,</hi> we are not glorified unleſſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> yet by beleeving we cannot be ſaid properly to glorifie our ſelves: ſo though we beleeve that we may be juſtified, yet will it not follow, that we may be therefore ſaid to juſtifie our ſelves properly: the reaſon is the ſame on both ſides. Now whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have us when beleevers, yet to be paſſive in our glorification, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe God doth firſt give faith, and then afterwards give glory: I wonder he ſees not the inſufficiency of ſuch anſwers, and how the Arminians get ground by them. Say plainly. Doth God require and charge us to beleeve and repent, that we may be ſaved, or doth he not? If he doth, then doth he require a condition to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our parts, in order to our Juſtification, though he give it us; for (as (<hi>o</hi>) Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> obſerves often) <hi>Medium ad aliquid obtinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116045:70"/> If he doth not, what ſhall become of thoſe many places, wherein God exhorts and commands men to repent and beleeve, that they may be ſaved? Then unbelief and impenitency are no ſins: nor are men thereby the cauſes of their own ruine and deſtruction, contrary to Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 3. 19, and 8. 24. <hi>&amp; paſſim.</hi> The reaſon is plain, becauſe mans not being the object of a gift of God preciſely, cannot be meritorious of his damnation. Indeed Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> told us before, that he that doth the leaſt work towards the procuring of a benefit, is not only phyſically, but morally active in obtaining it. I wonder at my heart then, why we pray for grace and ſalvation: or why we do or ſuffer any thing for obtaining a Crown and Kingdom. <note n="p" place="margin">Authores e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus primi fuere Sadoc (unde Sadducaei) &amp; Baythos. de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus videſis <hi>Joh.

And had I not known ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians fallen and falling off from prayer and ordinances, and other ſpiritual duties, upon this very ground, that they are paſſive altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their ſalvation, and that they neither can nor muſt do any thing toward it, I would not have loſt ſo much time as to have taken notice of it.</p>

                  <p>If there be no act of grace declared and publiſhed in the Word, which may be a legal diſcharge of the ſinner while he is in unbelief, then no unbelieving ſinner is juſtified.

                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> firſt denies the Aſſumption; <q>For the Goſpel declares that God hath tranſacted all the ſins of the Elect on Jeſus Chriſt: and that he by his offering hath made a full and perfect atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, whereby they are really made clean from all their ſins in the ſight of God as of old, carnal <hi>Iſrael</hi> were typically clean upon the atonement made by the High Prieſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 30.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Suppoſing the tenour of the Goſpel or New Covenant to be ſuch a declaration as this: yet I deny, that this declaration hath the forme or force of a Law, to abſolve the ſinner from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a former Law. The Reaſon's plain, becauſe it is but <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio rei geſtae,</hi> a meer hiſtorical narration of what hath been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted between God and Chriſt. And doth not Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſee, that if he yield it to have the nature and operation of a Law in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners, he contradicts himſelf in his next anſwer? wherein he denies, that Juſtification is the diſcharge of a ſinner by a declared act, that is, by a Law. Indeed, ſuch a Goſpel as he here ſpeaks of, may declare the ſinner to be diſcharged by ſome former act: but it ſelfe cannot be his diſcharge, and therefore the anſwer is nothing to the purpoſe. 2. The atonement made by Chriſt, may be ſaid to be perfect two wayes. 1. In reſpect of it ſelf, and ſo it was moſt perfect, as wanting nothing that was requiſite to conſtitute or make it a compleat cauſe of our peace. 2. In reference to its effects, and ſo it is yet imperfect, and ſhall continue ſo till the Saints be glorified, becauſe till then they ſhall not have the full effect, or perfection of peace, purchaſed in the death of Chriſt. If Mr <hi>Eyre</hi> mean this latter ſenſe, when he ſayes the Goſpel declares a full and perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement made by Chriſt: he begs the queſtion. In the former I grant it. 3. And ſo that the Elect were cleanſed from their ſins in the death of Chriſt <hi>quoad impetrationem,</hi> becauſe he obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal redemption and cleanſing for them; but not <hi>quoad applicationem,</hi> till they do beleeve, becauſe the remiſſion purchaſed in the death of Chriſt, is not applied or given to us till we believe. 4. Though the Prieſt made an atonement for all the ſins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon the day of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 30. yet did God require the concurrence of their afflicting themſelves, and humbling their ſoules on that day, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:116045:71"/> otherwiſe they ſhould have no benefit by that atonement, <hi>Lev. 23. 29. Whatſoever ſoule ſhall not be afflicted on that ſame day, he ſhall be cut off from among his people.</hi> Is not this to teach us, that without faith and repentance, we ſhall not have remiſſion by the death of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies the Propoſition; which ſtands upon<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> this ground, That Juſtification is the diſcharge of a ſinner, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed declared act.</p>
                  <p>Where note (Reader) that by a declared act, I mean, not an act of God, declaring and manifeſting to a ſinner that he is juſtified (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth willingly miſtake me, and thereupon patcheth a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequitur</hi> upon me, which I intend not to unſtitch) but ſuch a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his will, as is eſſential to make it a Law; for the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Law conſiſteth in this, that it is the declared will of the Law-giver, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. and 30. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the only rule that determines, both <hi>de debito officii,</hi> of what ſhall be our duty to do, and <hi>de debito poenae &amp; praemii,</hi> of what rewards or penalties ſhall become due to us. Accordingly, the thing I maintain is, that our diſcharge from puniſhment due by Law, muſt be by the revealed will, that is, by ſome contrary Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God. And I very well remember, that in private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> about nine or ten yeares ſince, I told him my judgement was ſo then: and that our Divines were generally dark, in opening the nature of Juſtification, for want of taking notice of it: to which he then conſented. But <hi>Tempora mutantur, &amp;c.</hi> the thing it ſelf I thus proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law,</hi> Rom. 5. 13. <hi>Ergo,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is righteouſneſſe imputed without Law.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, 1. <q>Though men will not impute or charge ſin upon themſelves, where there is not a Law to convince them of it, yet God may: for his hating of a perſon, is his imputing of ſin. The ſcope of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. is not to ſhew when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to impute ſin to a perſon, but that ſin in being ſuppoſeth a Law: and conſequently, that there was a Law before the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> indeed think, that when it is ſaid, <hi>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law,</hi> the meaning ſhould be, men will not impute ſin to themſelves where there is no Law? To impute ſin hath but two ſenſes in Scripture. 1. To puniſh it, 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 19. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. and then the meaning is, that men will
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116045:72"/> not puniſh themſelves where there is no Law; and becauſe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which the Apoſtle doth here inſtance in, is death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the full ſenſe will be this, that men will not kill themſelves where there is no Law: a very probable gloſſe. Or 2. To accuſe or charge the guilt of ſin upon a perſon. But the uſe of the Word will not allow us to underſtand it of a mans imputing or charging ſin upon himſelf. <note n="a" place="margin">Vid Guil. Eſthi. in loc.</note> For it is never uſed in all the Scriptures to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the act of a man upon himſelf, but perpetually the act of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon, ver. 18. If he owe thee any thing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to me:</hi> eſpecially when it is put paſſively, as here it is, ſin is not imputed. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. throughout. 3. And I do heartily wiſh Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would have given us a ſhort paraphraſe upon the thirteenth and fourteenth verſes, that we might have ſeen what tolerable ſenſe could have been made of them according to his Expoſition: and whether the Apoſtle do affirme or deny that men did impute ſin to themſelves before the Law; eſpecially if the Apoſtles ſcope be what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes it is, namely, to ſhew that ſin in being, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Law: how can it be conducible to that ſcope, to ſpeak of mens not imputing ſin to themſelves without a Law? 4. The grand deſigne of the Apoſtle is plainly to illuſtrate our ſalvation by Chriſt, by compariſon of contraries: and the ſimilitude in its full explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands thus. <hi>As by the diſobedience of Adam, ſin and death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon all his children: ſo by the obedience of Chriſt, life and righteouſneſſe betides all his.</hi> The Propoſition is ſet down, <hi>ver. 12. Wherefore, as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men for that all have ſinned.</hi> This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>ver,</hi> 13, 14. and the ſumme of the proof (as I take it) is this. <hi>Sin was imputed, and that unto death, from the beginning of the world. Ergo,</hi> there muſt be ſome Law in being, according to which ſin was imputed: for it cannot be imputed where there is no Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. This Law muſt be either the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi> The former it cannot be, for ſin and death were in the world long before that Law was given, even as long as from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt be the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi> And ſo hath the Apoſtle his purpoſe, That it was by the diſobedience of one (namely <hi>Adam</hi>) that ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin. From whence it is manifeſt, that God doth never impute ſin without a Law: that is, doth neither charge perſons as guilty of ſin, nor puniſh them for it (other ſenſe the phraſe of <hi>imputing ſin</hi> hath none in all the Scripture) for from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116045:72"/> the imputation of ſin unto death, the Apoſtle infers the neceſſity of a Law, according to which ſin was imputed in the long tract of time between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Gods hatred of reprobation is not his imputing of ſin, as being<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> antecedent to any act of the creature, whether good or evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> think otherwiſe, why have we not one ſyllable of proof, neither from Scripture nor reaſon, to warrant us to call the acts of God by ſuch new names as they were never known by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the world was made? The Apoſtle prayes, that the ſin of thoſe that deſerted him, be not laid to their charge, or imputed to them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. and the ſame ſenſe hath the prayer of <hi>Stephen</hi> for his murderers, <hi>Acts 7. 60. Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge,</hi> both which ſuppoſe the imputation or non-imputation of ſin to be a conſequent to it, not antecedent. And againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant language of Scripture, and of all men, muſt we be forced, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Authority then Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> bare word, to beleeve the imputation of ſin to be from eternity; and when the Apoſtle ſays, ſin is not imputed where there is no Law; we muſt beleeve, (for Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes it) that the meaning is, There is no ſin where there is no Law. Briefely, if ſin be imputed from eternity, men are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from eternity, which is impoſſible; for he that is not, is not miſerable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 24.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath a ſecond anſwer, and that is, <q>That<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> there is not the ſame reaſon of our being ſinners, and being righteous: ſeeing that ſin is our act, but righteouſneſſe is the gift of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> What then? yet there may be, and is the ſame reaſon of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting ſin, and imputing righteouſneſſe, which are both Gods acts. It is but changing the terme, and the matter will be clear. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute righteouſneſſe, and not to impute ſin, are termes much of the ſame ſignification with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 8. Now to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin, and to non-impute ſin, are contraries, (though the latter be expreſſed by a negative terme) <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are both of them actions of the ſame kinde and common nature. <hi>Contraria ſunt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita ſub eodem genere proximo. Ergo,</hi> there is the ſame reaſon for the one and the other, that if ſin cannot be imputed without Law, then neither non-imputed.</p>
                  <p>More particularly thus I argued, that as condemnation is no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret act or reſolution of God to condemn, but the very voice and ſentence of the Law, <hi>Curſed is he that ſinneth:</hi> ſo on the contrary,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116045:73"/> our Juſtification muſt be ſome declared ſentence or act of God, which may diſcharge the ſinner from condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That as condemnation comes upon men by vertue of that Law or Covenant which was made with the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo our Juſtification deſcends to us by vertue of that Law or Covenant which was made with the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> which New Covenant, and not the Conditional Promiſe, (as Mr. W. would have it) is called <hi>the Law of faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. <hi>and the Law of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 9. 31.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The reaſon then is acknowledged to be the ſame on both<note place="margin">§, 5.</note> ſides. <hi>Ergo,</hi> as condemnation is by a Law, ſo muſt Juſtification be, which was before denied. To what is here ſaid for explication I reply, 1. That the former part of it ſuppoſeth that which I will never grant, nor Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ever prove: and that is, That there is no condemnation which comes upon ſinners for moral tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi> Indeed that Law condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as the head of mankinde for his firſt diſobedience: and ſo condemneth all his poſterity for original ſin. But his poſterity are not concerned in thoſe perſonal ſins which he committed after his firſt tranſgreſſion; nor in the condemnation which became due to him for them: no more then they are ſubject to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for one anothers ſins. But that Law which was given to him at firſt as the common head of mankinde, and had effect upon him as ſuch; became afterwards of meer perſonal obligation, both upon him and all men elſe, for perſonal, actual ſins. So that no man now is, or ever was, ſince the firſt tranſgreſſion ſubject to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by that Law, <hi>quatenus</hi> it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for any perſonal ſins of their own: but as it was obliging immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon each man in his own perſon. And therfore the Law of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpeaks more perſonally. <hi>Curſed is every man that continueth not in every thing which is written in the Law to do it,</hi> Gal. 3. 9, 10. And by this Law is every tranſgreſſour condemned, not with a derivative condemnation, (ſuch I mean, as is derived, and as it were propagated from another) but ſuch whereof every ſinner in his own perſon is the firſt and immediate ſubject. And unto this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is our Juſtification moſt frequently oppoſed in Scripture. The Argument therefore hath yet no anſwer, nor nothing like it. The condemnation of a ſinner for his own perſonal ſins, is an act of God, condemning by a Law: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Juſtification which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thereto, is an act of God by a Law in like manner. 2. I deny
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116045:73"/> that condemnation comes upon any man, by vertue of the Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Adam,</hi> till himſelf be borne a childe of <hi>Adam. Ergo,</hi> from the acknowledged pnrity of reaſon it muſt follow, that no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the Covenant made with Chriſt, till himſelf be borne of Chriſt, that is, by faith, <hi>Gal. 3. 26. John</hi> 1. 12. 13. and 3. 5. ſo that in this reſpect the Argument is yielded. For clearing of the antecedent, note: That when it is wont to be ſaid, we were condemned in <hi>Adam,</hi> it is not to be underſtood properly, but with an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an <hi>As I may ſo ſay,</hi> to uſe the Apoſtles expreſſion, in a caſe not much unlike, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9, 10. As I may ſo ſay, <hi>Levi</hi> alſo paid tithes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he was yet in the loines of his father. Not as if we were then actually condemned, who then had no exiſtence: for he that is not, can be no more under Law, then he that is dead and free from Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. and 7. 3. and condemnation by Law, being a tranſient act, requires an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject exiſtent upon which it may paſſe. But becauſe the very ſame ſentence which condemned him then, takes hold without any reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all his poſterity ſucceſſively unto the ſame condemnation. Even as when it is ſaid, <hi>in Adam all di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 22. Not as if men could die before they are borne, but becauſe it was appointed and determined by the foreſaid Law, that all borne of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould die, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 27. And in this reſpect our ſpiritual being in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is as neceſſary to our partaking in his righteouſneſſe, as our natural being in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to our partaking in his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Yea. 3. It is a great deal more neceſſary: and therefore I deny<note place="margin">§. 6</note> Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> conſequence; for though it were yielded, that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation comes on men only by the Law of <hi>Adam:</hi> yet will it by no means follow, that Juſtification deſcends to us from Chriſt, as the immediate effect of that Law or Covenant by which himſelfe was juſtified. The reaſon is plain, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> repreſented all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as virtually in the ſame obligation with himſelf: (<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Paul. Ferrium ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt. Orthod. ſpe c.</hi> 20 §. 3.</note>) and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was the act of the whole humane nature, though it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to particular perſons, till they begin to exiſt: and his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was ſo far forth the condemnation of all mankinde, it being the very ſame ſentence that condemneth both him and us. But Chriſt Jeſus repreſented no man as in the ſame obligation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, either in his obedience or Juſtification: otherwiſe <hi>we</hi> are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by works, or <hi>he</hi> by grace: for we muſt be acknowledged to have ſatisfied Gods juſtice in him, and to have merited eternal life
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116045:74"/> in him, in the very ſame propriety of ſpeech, as we are ſaid to have ſinned and dyed in <hi>Adam:</hi> which I will never beleeve while I live: becauſe it excludes grace altogether from having any hand in the juſtification of a ſinner. The grace of our juſtification is uſually placed in theſe (<note n="c" place="margin">See the Aſſemb. confeſ. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. §. 3.</note>) two things. 1. In that Chriſt was given freely of the Father for us. 2. And his obedience and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tisfaction accepted in our ſtead. But in neither of theſe is there any grace at all, if we have merited and ſatisfied in him, as we are ſaid to ſin and die or be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam.</hi> For the Law it ſelf will allow us to make ſatisfaction if we are able (for it inflicts the penalty but in ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r to ſatisfaction: and the puniſhment of ſinners is not eternall, but becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie by bearing it). But if we have ſatisfied in Chriſt, it ſeems we were able to do it. <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>b eſſe ad poſſe valet conſequentia.</hi> And juſtice it ſelf will accept of ſatisfaction being performed. And as God deals not more rigorouſly with us in condemning us, then he did with <hi>Adam</hi> in condemning him: ſo neither doth he deale any whit more mercifully with us in juſtifying us, then he did with Chriſt in juſtifying him, if his ſatisfaction and juſtification be ours in the ſame ſenſe, in which <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne and condemnation is ours. How much ſafer is it to ſay with the Scripture, He is the propitiation for our ſinnes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. and that he hath obtained eternall redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. then to talke of our being in him a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our owne ſinnes: or of purchaſing in him redemption for our ſelves? The concluſion is; the Law that juſtified Chriſt cannot juſtifie us, though the law that condemned <hi>Adam,</hi> were yeelded to be the only law that condemneth us: (which yet I have already denyed) <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the Apoſtle having ſaid, that the law of faith excludes boaſting, he addes immediatly, <hi>v.</hi> 28. we conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law. To put faith for Chriſt is ſuch a piece of boldneſſe as I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon, as much as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> challength me for my forehead.

                  <p>IN the next place Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> offers us ſome Arguments to prove<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> that juſtification is not the diſcharge of a ſinner by that ſignall conditionall promiſe of the Goſpel, he that believes ſhall be ſaved. Let us try then (for whereas he cenſures that ſaying of mine, <hi>every man is then condemned when the Law condemnes him,</hi> I ſtay not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him: he might have ſeen, if he would, that I intended no more then, that whoſoever is condemned, is condemned by a Law.)</p>
                  <p>What then are the Arguments? The firſt is <hi>crambe bis</hi> (ſhall I ſay, or) <hi>decies cocta,</hi> that it will inferre juſtification by works: for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which I referre the reader to <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and 5. having proved in the former, that it is the Act or grace of faith which the Apoſtle perpetually oppoſeth to works: and in the latter, that benefits may be given of grace, which yet are given upon condition.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument therefore is this. <q>If juſtification be by that ſignall promiſe, he that beleeves ſhall be ſaved, then none were juſtified before that gracious ſentence was publiſhed. But the Fathers of the old Teſtament were juſtified before the publiſhing of that gracious ſentence, or any like it,</q>

                  <p>In <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time the matter is clearer then to need proofe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1, 2. Let us therefore feare, leaſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it: for unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, being not mixed with faith in them that heard it. Hence 1. it is manifeſt, that ſalvation was promiſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the type of reſt in <hi>Canaan.</hi> 2. That it was not promiſed them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but upon condition (whether the condition were expreſſed, or underſtood) otherwiſe their non-entrance into Reſt muſt have been imputed wholly to Gods unfaithfulneſſe, and not to their unbelief: whereas the text ſayes expreſly, it was their unbelief which made the promiſe of no effect to them; and they could not enter in becauſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116045:76"/> of unbelief, <hi>chap.</hi> 3, 19. 3. That the Goſpel is preached to us as it was to them: and therefore the ſame condition is required of us, as was required of them, namely faith: otherwiſe we alſo ſhall fall ſhort of the promiſed reſt, as they did, <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The third Argument is this. If juſtification be only by a declared<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> diſcharge, then elect infants that die in their infancy have no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I deny the conſequence, where's the proofe? I can find no other but this, that infants are inſenſible of this declaration, and unable to plead their diſcharge from any ſuch promiſe: which is nothing in the world to the purpoſe. Cannot infants have right to a benefit by law, or the declared act of a Rector or Lawgiver, becauſe they are unſenſible of it, and cannot plead it? They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by law whiles infants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. They may be ſervants or free by law. Do not our laws provide for the rights of Minors, Pupils and Orphans, even in their infancy? 2. It doth alſo ruine the maine pillars of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> diſcourſe. All the places which I before alledged to prove juſtification by faith, according to him, are to be underſtood of the manifeſtation of juſtification to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Give me leave then to retort his owne Argument. The juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſpoken of in the places aforeſaid, <hi>Gal. 2. 16. Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and 4. 24. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. and 13. 39. &amp;c. is, that without which no man can be ſaved. But ſome may be ſaved without juſtification manifeſted and declared to the conſcience: as infants. <hi>Ergo</hi> the juſtification mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe places is not juſtification in conſcience, or manifeſted unto conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument ſucceeds. <q>The making juſtification a<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> declared diſcharge, detracts from the majeſty and ſoveraignty of God, for it aſcribes to him but the office of a notary or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Miniſter (whoſe work it is to declare and publiſh the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court) rather then of a Judge or ſupream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> If this Argument be caſt into forme, it runs thus. He that forgives ſin by a declared Act, is but a notary or ſubordinate Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (for their work it is to declare and publiſh the ſentence of the Court.) But God (according to me) pardons ſin by a declared Act. <hi>Ergo</hi> (according to me) God in juſtifying or pardoning ſin is but as a notary or ſubordinate Miniſter. I can ſcarcely believe that there is any reader will need my help, to anſwer ſuch arguings as theſe. I deny the propoſition. The proofe of it is, <hi>à baculo ad angulum.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:116045:76"/> It is the office of a notary to declare the ſentence of the Court. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he that pardons offences by a publique Act or Law, is a notary. 2. And yet if God publiſh his owne Laws, he doth nothing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Majeſty and Soveraignty. He publiſhed his Law to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf; and will publiſh the finall ſentence which ſhall paſſe upon all men at judgement: and our Lord Jeſus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Goſpel with his owne mouth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Argument is all one with the firſt, and ſo is anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſixth and laſt Argument is <hi>à pari.</hi> Forgiveneſſe amongſt men is not neceſſarily by a declared diſcharge; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Gods is not, for we are bid to forgive one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Suppoſing that the Antecedent ſpeak of private men onely<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> forgiving perſonal injuries one to another, I deny the conſequence. And one reaſon of my denial follows preſently. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. proves well that Gods forgiving us ſhould be a motive to us to forgive one another: but it doth by no means prove that our forgiveneſſe one of another, is an act of the ſame kinde and nature with Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of us. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 11. If God hath ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another: though our love one to another be not univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the ſame with Gods love to us. And yet, as our love, ſo our forgiveneſſe may in ſome reſpects reſemble his: as in the freeneſſe, fulneſſe and dureableneſſe of it, and in the effects which it produceth on the perſons forgiven: but every way like it, it neither can nor ought to be. 1. God forgives none without ſatisfaction: we muſt. 2. No private man is Governour and Judge of his brother: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his forgiveneſſe cannot be ſuch as Gods is, who forgiveth as ſupreame Judge and lawgiver, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 12. 3. Nor can Gods forgiveneſſe be like mans, if it conſiſt in the act of his minde or will: for if we will ſpeak properly; a mans will not to proſecute one that hath injured him, is not called pardon and forgiveneſſe ſimply, becauſe it is an act of the will: but becauſe it is ſuch an act as ſuppoſeth on his part that is pardoned, ſome injury done; and on his part that pardoneth, ſome right to require or demand ſatisfaction: neither of which can be ſuppoſed to be the will of God, which was from eternity. 4. Private forgiveneſſe is no juſtification of the perſon forgiven. A man may forgive his murtherers (as <hi>Stephen</hi> did) yet neither the laws of God or man will permit them to go unpuniſhed. But Gods act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116045:77"/> is withall the juſtification of a ſinner. <hi>Ergo,</hi> is not ſuch an act as private mens remiſſion of perſonall injuries. Other differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences it were eaſie to adde: but I ſhall inſiſt only on that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                  <p>The forgiveneſſe of a Magiſtrate being an act of authority muſt<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> be by ſome formal act of oblivion. And ſo Gods forgiveneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in like manner an act of authority muſt be alſo by ſome formall act of pardon that ſhall make the Law of condemnation to be of no force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. 1. <q>That he ſees no reaſon why God ſhould not have as much power to forgive without a promulged Act, as man; and chargeth me with boldneſſe for limiting God to ſuch a way of forgiveneſſe: becauſe Gods forgiveneſſe is no leſſe an act of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then mans, <hi>Rom. 5. 8. Eph.</hi> 2. 4. And though God in the act of forgiveneſſe may be looked upon as a Judge, yet is he ſuch a Judge as proceeds by no other Law then his own will.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The firſt part of the anſwer is ridiculous: as if a private man had more power then the ſupream Magiſtrate, becauſe he forgives an injury without a promulged Act: or as if it were through defect of power in the Magiſtrate that he forgives by a Law or Act of grace. A private man remits an injury, as it is an injury and hurt to himſelf: but as it is a breach of the Law of God or man, he neither doth nor can remit it: as in the caſe before-mentioned of a man forgiving his murtherers. Therefore it is but a very imperfect pardon which a private man can give. But it argues eminency and perfection of power to pardon by an Act of grace: becauſe no Law can contradict it, but it diſannulls and invalidates them all: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. The Covenant which was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the Law cannot diſannul to make the promiſe of no effect. The confirming of the Covenant (according to the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the Greek (<hi>f</hi>) words <gap reason="foreign">

Grac ling. 1058. &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a in</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 8</note> 15. are then ratified or confirmed, when they want nothing which the Law of nature or particular Nations requires to make them valid. Therefore to argue for a power in God, to forgive as private men forgive, is to plead for a power in God to become weak, and to act imperfectly and unlike himſelfe. 2. When Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> talkes of my boldneſſe in limiting God, I ſuppoſe it is for want of a better anſwer. I never heard before that it was a limiting of God, to determine his actions according to the relations which they flow from as their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116045:77"/> principle. Thus do we diſtinguiſh the actions of God, as a Maker, a Soveraigne, a Father, a Lawgiver and Judge, as juſt, as merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Belike if I ſhould ſay God cannot condemne men as a Father, I limit God: or that he cannot ſave ſinners as juſt, (oppoſing juſtice to mercy), or that he cannot act as the Governour and Judge of mankind in condemning and juſtifying, without a Law. 3, When he determines Gods forgiveneſſe to be an act of charity, if he mean of charity as oppoſed to authority (as he muſt do, if he ſpeak any thing to purpoſe) he overthrows wholly the neceſſity and uſe of Chriſts ſatisfaction. For if Gods forgiveneſſe of us, be meerly an act of charity (ſuch as private mens forgiveneſſe one of another) then ſatisfaction is no more neceſſary to Gods forgiving us then to our forgiveneſſe one of another. Nor can it be of any uſe: for it can neither put the beginning nor increaſe of love in God, which is in him without beginning or addition: nor doth it remove that which hinders the effects of his love from being communicated unto us: for that forgiveneſſe which is purely an act of charity is <hi>cedendo de jure ſuo,</hi> by bearing an injury, and parting with that right which a man hath to require ſatisfaction: and if God forgive after this manner, the caſe is too plaine to need proofe, that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is of no uſe at all to make way for the forgiveneſſe of ſin, but rather a hindrance and contradiction thereunto. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> cannot be ignorant that the whole weight of the cauſe between the Socinians &amp; us, depends upon the truth of that which he here denies, namely, that condemnation and juſtification are the Acts of God as Rector, and ſupream Judge of men. If he will but review <hi>Cameron, Gerhard, Crotius, Suarez,</hi> or any other, Papiſt or Proteſtant, who is accounted to have wrote judiciouſly and orthodoxly upon that point, he will ſee that they fetch the foundation of their defenſe from this very principle.<note place="margin">§. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. The texts alledged to prove that Gods forgiveneſſe is no leſſe an act of charity then mans, prove it not. They ſhew indeed that our juſtification in <hi>actu exercito</hi> is an effect of the love of God; it being his love only which moved him to ſend Jeſus Chriſt to purchaſe juſtification for us, and thereupon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on us, (but with the preſervation of the honour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Law). Nevertheleſſe the ſame juſtification is an Act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in its kind, nature, definition and eſſentiall conſtitution, without that love of God. Even as a King out of ſpecial affection to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour condemned (ſuppoſe it be his owne ſonne) may find out.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:116045:78"/> a way to ſatisfie for his offence, and conſequently to diſcharge him: here the diſcharge doth not exiſt but by virtue of the Kings love and good affection: yet the pardon it ſelfe, <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> for its kind and nature, is a rectoral judicial act; not of private charity.</p>
                  <p>5. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> yeelds at laſt, that God in the act of forgiveneſſe<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> may be looked upon as a Judge: yet as ſuch a judge as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by no other Law then his owne will. Where, either the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part contradicts all that hath been hitherto ſaid about Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving men, as private men forgive perſonal injuries; for as no man in the very ſame Act can be looked upon as a Judge, and a private perſon (for there cannot be two formal principles of the very ſame action) ſo neither can God: or the latter part contradicts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for he that hath no other rule but his own will, is neither a Judge, who proceeds <note n="g" place="margin">L.

But in the juſtification of a ſinner God hath no need of ſuch an act, becauſe he is the ſole Judge and juſtifier himſelf: and therefore the purpoſe of his will ſecures the perſon ſufficiently, and makes the Law of condemnation of no force in regard of the reall execution of it.</q>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:116045:78"/> he pretend that a Magiſtrate cannot pardon his ſubjects involved in common guilt, by a promulged Act, becauſe <hi>one</hi> end of promulgation is the direction of inferiour Miniſters of State? 2. <note n="h" place="margin">Vid.

It cannot rationally be imagined that Magiſtrates ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to oblige their ſubjects by that will which they never intend to reveale: and ſurely will without obligation, is no Law. And the firſt and immediate effect of this Law (if it be a Law of grace) is to give offendours a right to impunity, any Act or Law to the contrary in any wiſe notwithſtanding. The direction of inferiour Judges is but the ſecondary uſe of it (and in the caſe between God and us, of no uſe at all, becauſe himſelf is both Lawgiver and Judge; reſerving each mans cauſe to his own peculiar cognizance) for if it be for their direction, what doth it direct them in? ſurely in the adminiſtration of juſtice: which conſiſts in giving every man his due. But impunity is not due to offendours but by virtue of ſome Act of grace. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the firſt effect of ſuch an Act is to conſtitute ſuch a right. 3. It is neceſſary that ſuch a generall pardon as is the Act of the ſupream Judge and Lawgiver, ſhould be by a Law of grace: not that God needs it (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> inſinuates) but becauſe the nature of the thing requires it. If God forgives by the purpoſe of his will, then he doth not forgive as a Rector. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath before granted that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to puniſh is included in the decree of election as part of it: but election is neither an Act of juſtice nor of mercy, but of abſolute dominion and liberty. So that the ſumme of theſe ſayings is this. Though God forgive as ſupream Judge, yet it is not neceſſary that he ſhould forgive as other Judges do, becauſe he may forgive as he is not a Judge, <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſecret purpoſe of his will. And yet as God may (very improperly) be ſaid to need that which is moſt conducible to the glory of his Government, ſo is it needfull in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his judgement, whether of juſtification or condemnation, proceed according to his revealed promulged Laws.

                  <p>4. And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells us again, that the Purpoſe of Gods Will doth ſufficiently ſecure the ſinner, and make the Law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to be of no force, as to the real execution of it: we have before ſhewed at large the miſchievous conſequences of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. If this be ſo, to what purpoſe imaginable did Chriſt die?
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116045:79"/> at leaſt, there was no need he ſhould die to redeem us from the curſe of an abrogated Law, which by an eternal Act was made of no force at all to condemne. Before, when the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt lay at ſtake for the credit of an eternal Juſtification, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> was content to yield them this honour, that they purchaſed the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, (though not the act) of Juſtification, which effect he told us was our non-punition. But here he tells us, that the purpoſe of Gods Will doth ſufficiently ſecure us from puniſhment: which though (I confeſſe) it be more rationally ſpoken, becauſe that act is moſt unworthy to be called the cauſe of our non-punition, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemnation, which is not able to effect it, without the help of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other more ſufficient cauſe; yet is it moſt perniciouſly ſpoken, as not leaving ſo much as the effects of our Juſtification, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence excluding both act and effects from any dependance upon the merits of Chriſt for their exiſtence. 2. Were <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> either or both, obliged by the Law to puniſhment upon their diſobedience, or no? If not, their ſin did them no harme, nor was there any truth in that ſevere commination, <hi>In the day you eat thereof, you ſhall ſurely die:</hi> and it is paſt diſpute; they died by force of that Law, and all their poſterity to this day. <hi>Rom. 5. 12, 13, 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 22, 56. And if ſo, then was not that Law made of no force by the eternal purpoſe of God: for if that Purpoſe of God do not hinder, but that men are legally obliged to condemnation upon breach of the Law; neither will Gods Juſtice and Faithfulneſſe permit that they go unpuniſhed, unleſſe his Law be ſatisfied ſome other way, <hi>Numb. 23. 19. God is not a man that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of man that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpeken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Therefore it is, that we have before denied, that there is in God any purpoſe preciſely of not puniſhing. 3. The Supreme Magiſtrate may neglect the execution of Laws with impunity to himſelfe; becauſe if he be Supreme, he is not accountable to any other humane authority: but not without ſuch a Proſtitution of the authority of his Lawes, and the honour of his own Government to contempt and obloq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:116045:79"/> the Houſe. So the publication of the New Covenant was for the comfort of Gods Elect, and not for their ſecurity <hi>in foro Dei.</hi>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Our queſtion is not preciſely what is the end of promulgation, but what is the effect of the Law promulged: which (ſay I) is to give offendors a right to impunity, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> cannot deny: though it be very true, that ſuch a Law be alſo for the comfort of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, namely ſecondarily and <hi>conſequenter;</hi> for it comforts him, in that it gives him a right to deliverance from deſerved puniſhment. His right and his comfort are not oppoſites, but both the effects of the ſame Law, and the latter ſubordinate to the former: ſo that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto there is nothing that contradicts me. 2. It is alſo true, that it is not the Magiſtrate who needs an act of grace, but offendors need it: for if the ſame authority which bound them under puniſhment, do not alſo diſcharge them from it, they cannot legally eſcape it. 3. When it is ſaid the Act of Oblivion was a real pardon when it paſſed the Houſe, it hath reference to what I ſaid in my Sermon, That a Vote in the Houſe, or a Declaration that an Act of Pardon ſhall come out, is no legal ſecurity to a Delinquent: by which I intended to declare, that neither the Purpoſe of God within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but the Law of grace, which in time he eſtabliſhed, according to his eternal purpoſe, was that act which pardoned the ſinner: which if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would have contradicted, he ſhould have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the meer purpoſe or reſolution of the Houſe to make ſuch an Act, is that very pardon which diſchargeth Delinquents. The Act it ſelf being once paſſed, may be yielded to be a Law, as being the declared will of the Lawgivers conſtituting a right to impunity, though by printing, writing or proclamation it be afterwards made more publick.

That God hath given unto Chriſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Government over all men. 2. That this Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a power of remitting ſins. 3. That this power is exerciſed in enacting that gracious Law, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> for ſo doth the Lord ſpeak, <hi>Go ye therefore into all the world, &amp;c.</hi> (which particle <hi>therefore</hi> I have borrowed from <hi>Matthew; ver.</hi> 19. and put it into the words of <hi>Mark</hi>) arguing manifeſtly from the right and authority which he had received, to the lawful exerciſe of it in making and ordering to be publiſhed that Law or Act of Pardon, whereof he doth then and there appoint his diſciples to be Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. I confeſſe I cannot imagine what can here be ſaid, unleſſe it be one of theſe two things. Either, 1. That remiſſion of ſin is not contained in that ſalvation which is here promiſed to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. But this (me thinks) ſhould be too harſh for any Chriſtians eares to endure: ſeeing it muſt contain all that good which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to condemnation; and therefore primarily remiſſion of ſins: which is alſo expreſly mentioned by the other Evangeliſts, <hi>Luke 24. 47. John</hi> 20. 23. and by the Apoſtles, in the execution of this their commiſſion, as a prime part of that ſalvation which they preached in the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Acts 2. 38. and 3. 19, &amp;c.</hi> Or 2. That thoſe words, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> are a meer deſcription of the perſons that ſhall be ſaved (which I think is the ſenſe that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſomewhere doth put upon them) but this to me is more intolerable then the former: partly for the reaſons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and to be mentioned hereafter: partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to ſuch an interpretation, the words will be no more

                  <p>If judgement ſhall paſſe at the laſt day according to the Word, then the Word is that Law which is the rule of judgement, (and by conſequence, to one is given by the Word a right to life, and another is obliged to condemnation by the ſame Word.)

But whether the word be expreſſed or no, it is ſurely implied: for the Apoſtles ſcope is to diſſwade us from judging one another, <hi>ver. 11. becauſe there is one Lawgiver, to whom the power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſo of abſolving and condemning, of ſaving and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>doth appertain.</hi> Now he that ſaves as a Lawgiver, ſaves by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and he that abſolves as a Lawgiver, abſolves by Law. <hi>Ergo,</hi> God abſolves men, that is, pardons and juſtifies them by Law. And when he ſhall judge all men at the laſt day; his judgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſalvation or deſtruction, ſhall proceed according to Law.</p>
                  <p>5. Adde to this, that the Apoſtle commends the excellency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> of the Goſpel, that God doth thereby juſtifie, 2 <hi>Cor 3. 9. For if the miniſtration of condemnation he glory, much more doth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of righteouſneſſe exceed in glory.</hi> The miniſtration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is that which <hi>ver.</hi> 7. he calls <hi>the miniſtration of death, written and engraven in ſtones.</hi> His ſcope is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſhew the excellency of that Goſpel, which himſelf and other Apoſtles did preach and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to the world; above the miniſtration of the Law committed to <hi>Moſes.</hi> As then the miniſtration of death and condemnation was the miniſtration of that Law, which did condemn unto death, (the effect being put for the cauſe) ſo the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116045:81"/> is the miniſtration of that Law or Word that juſtifies, the effect being put for the cauſe in like manner. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Juſtification is by Law.</p>

That the power for which the Apoſtle here extolls it is, in that it ſaves them that beleeve. 3.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y ſecond Argument, by which I proved that men are not juſtified before faith, was this.</p>
                  <p>They that are under condemnation, cannot at the<note place="margin">§, 1.</note> ſame time be juſtified. But all the world are under condemnation before faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none of the world are juſtified before faith.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> firſt enters a caution againſt the <hi>major:</hi> which I had briefly, and (as I thought, and yet think) ſufficiently proved in my Sermon in theſe words. Juſtification and Condemnation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries: and contraries cannot be verified of the ſame ſubject at the ſame time. Juſtification is a moral life, and condemnation a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death: a man can be no more in a juſtified ſtate, and a ſtate of condemnation both at once, then he can be alive and dead both at
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116045:82"/> once; or a bleſſed man and a curſed man both at once. What? that the Apoſtle deſcribes Juſtification by non-condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and oppoſeth it to condemnation as inconſiſtent with it, on the ſame perſon at the ſame time, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34. and are at as moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity one with another, as good and evil, light and darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe grounds I ſaid, that the Propoſition muſt needs be true. This (as if I had not ſo much as pretended any reaſon for it) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells his Reader is my confident aſſertion: but in the mean time, never goes about to remove the grounds upon which it ſtands. This is a ſad caſe: but who can help it?</p>
                  <p>Yet he will grant the Propoſition with this Proviſo, <q>That theſe ſeeming contraries do refer <hi>ad idem, i. e.</hi> to the ſame Court and Judicatory, not otherwiſe: for he that is condemned, and hath a judgement on record againſt him in one Court, may be juſtified and abſolved in another. He that is caſt at common Law, may be quitted in a Court of equity. He that is condemned in the Court of the Law, may be juſtified in the Court of the Goſpel.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Which is very true: otherwiſe our Juſtification were no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But I would ask. Are theſe two Courts coordinate, and of equal power? or is the one in power ſubordinate to the other? If the former, how ſhall a man know whether he be caſt or abſolved? as in our own caſe, If the Law be of as much power to condemne, as the Goſpel is to juſtifie, how ſhall a man know whether he be condemned or juſtified? or what ſentence ſhall a poor ſoul expect, when he is going to appear before Gods Tribunal? if of abſolution, why the Law condemnes him? if of condemnation, the Goſpel ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies him? and which of theſe two ſhall take place? But if the one be ſubordinate to the other, then the ſentence of the ſuperiour Court reſcindes the judgement of the inferiour, and makes it of no force, and ſo the man is not abſolved and condemned both at once.

Therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that the ſame perſon at the ſame time, and in reference to the ſame ſins, ſhould ſtand condemned and juſtified before God. 2. Nevertheleſſe, I alſo think that a man may be condemned (I mean <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> under an actual obligation to puniſhment) and yet be in <hi>a ſtate of Juſtification,</hi> at the ſame time: which becauſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, I ſhould explain, for the better underſtanding of the oppoſition between Juſtification and Condemnation, I ſhall here once for all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:116045:83"/> ſet down my opinion. A ſtate of Juſtification I call it, not ſimply, becauſe all ſins are actually pardoned (for multitudes may not be yet committed) but becauſe all paſt ſins are pardoned, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe given to the ſinner, by which all future ſins ſhall be pardoned: mercy prevailing againſt juſtice, Mount <hi>Sion</hi> againſt Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> Mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> againſt Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> even as a man is then in a ſtate of grace and regeneration, not becauſe he hath no ſin in him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a ſpirit of life within him, prevailing more and more againſt the luſts and rebellions of his fleſh, till at laſt ſin be perfectly deſtroyed out of the ſoule. And ſo my opinion is, 1. That as ſoon as a man beleeves, all his ſins paſt are forgiven him. 2. As often as he falls into new ſins, he contracts upon himſelf a new guilt, or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to puniſhment by vertue of the Law: ſo as it were juſt with God to deſtroy him, notwithſtanding his former ſins be pardoned. 3. The Lord Jeſus, our Advocate with the father, doth continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent and plead the Promiſe of remiſſion made in his blood, on the behalf of ſinners: by vertue of which, not only the preſent and ſpeedy execution of puniſhment is ſuſpended, but the ſinners right to ſalvation continued and renewed, notwithſtanding his new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted guilt (<note n="x" place="margin">Juſtificatio toties ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus far I grant, that in theſe viciſſitudes, Juſtification and Condemnation may conſiſt in the ſame perſon: but by no meanes can I yield, that a man can at the ſame time ſtand condemned for thoſe very ſins, from which the Goſpel juſtifies him: or that he can be in a ſtate of Juſtification and a ſtate of Condemnation both at once.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>The Law (ſayes Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) condemns all men living, for that all have ſinned. The Law doth not conſider men as El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſeems then that the elect and believers are as much under the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> condemnation of the Law, as reprobates and unbelievers: the Law (if I underſtand theſe words) condemning no man effectually, that is, holding no man guilty, ſo that he ſhall need to fear condemnation by the Law, unleſſe there be ſome other more effectual cauſe of his condemnation: though the Law condemne him for as much as in it lies, or to the utmoſt of its power, or in ſom reſpect only, but not ſimply and univerſally. This (I think) is the meaning of theſe words: but becauſe there may be ſome other myſtery under them, which I am not able to reach, I ſhall ſet down my anſwer by way of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. Whether the elect and believers be not in as much danger of hell fire, as the reprobate and unbelievers? If it be ſaid (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it muſt) that the danger of both is equal <hi>by the Law,</hi> (though ſome other act of God put a difference betwixt them) I would ask, 2. What is that curſe of the Law, which Chriſt hath redeemed us from? for if the Law condemn only for its own part, or foraſmuch as in it lies, but never had power to hold the ſinner under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wrath, neither was there any need that Chriſt ſhould die to redeem us from the curſe of that Law: nor can we be redeemed, becauſe the Law hath the very ſame power over us after his death, yea, and after our faith, as it had before, even by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for it condemnes all men equally without diſtinction. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Law do condemn any man at all? yes (will it be ſaid) ſo far as its power reacheth, which is thus far: that he that tranſgreſſeth the Law, can expect no benefit by the Law, or he forſeits his right to life and bleſſedneſſe, by that Law which he hath tranſgreſſed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he may at the ſame time have right to life by ſome other act of God: But 1. Is that ſaying true or falſe, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law to do them?</hi> I will not ſo much as ſuſpect that any man that is called a Chriſtian, will ſay there was no truth in that threatening: and if there be truth in it, then he that tranſgreſſeth the Law is in a curſed eſtate (till at laſt he be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it, through faith in the blood of Chriſt): and if he be curſed, then ſurely the Law hath more power over him, then to deprive him of his right to life, as to any help it ſelf can afford him. He is curſed who hath no right at all to life: if he hath no right by the Law, yet is he never a whit the more miſerable for that, as long as he hath right by any other act of God. 2. And if he hath no right by any other act, yet is he not condemned. The Law indeed doth its part towards his condemnation: but it ſeemes, it condemnes him no
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:116045:84"/> farther, then that as if there be no other act that condemnes him more effectually, the ſinner remaines uncondemned notwithſtanding: for to be condemned by the Law, is not to be condemned ſimply in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe; for believers themſelves (according to him) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, who yet are not ſimply condemned; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of this notion we muſt ſpeak by and by.</p>
                  <p>But the Aſſumption is that againſt which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> makes the moſt<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> profeſſed oppoſition, namely, that all the world is under condemnation before faith. This Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies. And why?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Becauſe it was the Will of God that none of the elect ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or be condemned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True: not executively. But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows, we put a difference between periſhing and condemnation in this debate: and that by condemnation we mean, not the execution of puniſhment or wrath, but a legal obligation to the ſuffering of it. And though God did purpoſe that the elect ſhould not periſh, or be condemned executively, &amp; <hi>quoad eventum:</hi> yet ſhould Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove, that he purpoſed that the elect ſhould not ſtand obliged equally with other ſinners, for ſome time, to the ſuffering of wrath. This if he prove, I will yield the cauſe. The purpoſe of God in it ſelfe makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between men, whoſe cauſe is the ſame before the juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judge. Do we not know that a Prince may purpoſe to ſave the life of a Malefactour, againſt whom notwithſtanding the Law is in force, and judgement proceeds, and ſentence paſſeth, and the man thereby as much obnoxious to death, as any other Melefactours, till ſome other act of the Prince, beſides his meer purpoſe, interpoſe and prevent his death? But of this we have ſpoken largely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſumption, namely, that all the world is under condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> before faith; I proved from the expreſſe teſtimony of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>John 3. 18. He that beleeveth not, is condemned already.</hi> 
                     <q>That is (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) He that never believeth, as <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 24. If you beleeve not (<hi>i. e.</hi> not at all) you ſhall die in your ſins. Our Saviour had no intent at all to ſhew the ſtate of the elect before believing: but the certain and inevitable miſery of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, by reaſon of the ſentence of the Law that had paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</q> All the reſt of the anſwer conſents well enough with that Explication of the text which I gave in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Firſt, for that which is pretended to be our Lords intent in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:116045:84"/> theſe words, let me intreat thee (Reader) to peruſe and ponder the text; for I think thou ſhalt hardly meet with the like abuſe of the Oracles of God, in any Authour that acknowledgeth the Divinity of Scriptures, <hi>ver. 14. As Moſes lift up the Serpent in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>That whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have everlaſting life,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>for God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>for God ſent not his Sonne into the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>He that beleeveth, is not condemned: he that beleeveth not, is condemned already, &amp;c.</hi> Thou ſeeſt (Reader) that the words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a moſt ſerious and faithful teſtimony to a ſinful world, that though they had brought upon themſelves eternal miſeries, yet God had ſent his Sonne into the world, not to condemn the world, but to ſave them: and if any man periſh, 'tis not for want of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient remedy provided in the death of Chriſt, but for their own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful refuſal to embrace and make uſe of it: as himſelfe tells us, <hi>ver. 19. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> Now what ſayes Mr. <hi>Eyre?</hi> why he will have us beleeve, that the Lords intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is quite againſt his expreſſion, and that he is come to teſtifie to the world, that their miſery is certain and inevitable, by reaſon of the ſentence of the Law that had paſſed upon them. It is time to burne our Bibles, if ſuch gloſſes as theſe muſt be received for truth. 2. If the miſery of thoſe that beleeve not be inevitable, by reaſon of the ſentence of the Law, how is this to be underſtood? either that the Law paſſed ſentence upon them as unbelievers: (but this I ſuppoſe is too unreaſonable to be affirmed:) or that the ſame men, who afterwards prove unbelievers, were before ſentenced by the Law to certain and unavoidable miſery. But then their unbeliefe contributed nothing to make their miſery unavoidable: whereas our Lord chargeth the unavoidableneſſe of miſery upon wilful unbelief, <hi>ver. 19. This is the condemnation,</hi> (not that men are in darkneſſe) but <hi>that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkneſſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then light.</hi> Were it not for this, men might do well enough, notwithſtanding all that the Law had done againſt them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> miſery is not made certain and inevitable to any by the Law, before unbelief be added. 3. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> told us but now, that the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all men equally (that's the ſenſe of his words, if there be any
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116045:85"/> ſenſe in them.) The Law (ſaith he) doth not conſider men as elect or reprobate (I know not how it ſhould: for the Law is neither God, nor man, nor Angel) as believers or unbelievers, &amp;c. how comes it then to paſſe that miſery ſhould be made unavoidable to one, and not to another by the ſame Law?</p>
                  <p>Next, we ſhall enquire into Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Expoſition of <hi>ver.</hi> 18.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>He that beleeveth not is condemned already;</hi> that is, (ſaith he) he that never beleeveth, which is not only <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> ſpoken without ſo much as a pretence of Reaſon, but is manifeſtly inconſiſtent with the text. Indeed condemnation is executed upon none, but final unbelievers: but unbelievers in the text are to be underſtood general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all unbelievers whatſoever, and not to be confined to final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. 1. Such unbelievers are here meant, who are part of that world into which Chriſt is ſent: for after the Lord had ſaid, <hi>ver. 17. God ſent not his Sonne into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved;</hi> He diſtributes this world into two parts, Beleevers and Unbeleevers, <hi>ver. 18. He that beleeveth, is not condemned: he that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> But final unbeleevers as ſuch, are no part of that world into which Chriſt is ſent: for a final unbeleever is he that dies in unbelief: if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve but one minute before his death, he is not a final unbeleever. And Chriſt is not ſent to the dead, but to the living. 2. Such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers are here meant whom Chriſt was ſent to ſave, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. But Chriſt was not ſent to ſave final unbelievers as ſuch. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch unbelievers are not here meant. 3. We have alſo mention of a double condemnation in the text: one which Chriſt findes men under when he comes into the world, and which he comes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18. The other which men are left under for final unbelief, and rejecting of Chriſt the light of life, <hi>ver. 19. This is the condemnation, &amp;c.</hi> for Chriſt could not finde men condemned for a final rejecting of him, till he had been preached and tendered to them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they that beleeve not, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. are unbeleevers in general. 4. The condemnation here ſpoken of, is that which is avoidable (and is actually avoided) by beleeving. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not the condemnation of final unbeleevers.

                     <hi>Eyre</hi> tells me, <q>That to ſay the place hints, there is a wrath of God which is done away by believing, is but an attempt to ſuborne the Spirit to ſerve our turne.</q> A ſhort way of anſwering Arguments. <note n="y" place="margin">Contra Crell. p. 452, 453.</note> This very interpretation doth <hi>Eſſenius</hi> vindicate at large againſt Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> friends (in the point of eternal reconciliation) the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and urgeth the ſignificancy of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

And yet ſurely in ſo ſaying he doth more then hint, that the wrath of God may be eſcaped by believing.</p>
                  <p>5. And that I do not erre in the meaning of the holy Ghoſt, I am yet farther convinced, becauſe the Lord came not into the world to<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> give life ſimply, but to give ſalvation, <hi>v.</hi> 17. that is, to give life to them that were dead. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they whom he ſaves were dead, <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto:</hi> as the Apoſtle argues, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. If one died for all, then were all dead. And to be dead in Law, is to be under condemnation. Now whom doth Chriſt ſave? not final unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, but ſuch as are unbeleevers for a time only: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they who are now beleevers, were ſometime under condemnation, or elſe Chriſt never ſaved them. If they are only condemned in themſelves, or by the Law (in that diminutive reſpective ſenſe in which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> uſeth that phraſe) they are never a whit the more in danger of periſhing for that, and therefore not capable of being ſaved properly. 6. The compariſon which our Lord propoſeth, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. and upon which this whole diſcourſe dependeth, puts it yet farther out of doubt. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifted up, that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.

                     </gap>pariſon, and paſſe on. 1. As then the people for whom the ſerpent was lifted up, were all mortally ſtung of the fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116045:86"/> (ſee the ſtory it ſelf, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 6, 7, 8, 9.) So is all the world become ſubject to condemnation through ſin, (for the people that were ſtung in the type, are the world in the Antitype: and their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound there, is condemnation here, by our Lords own expoſition, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 19.) 2. That as the ſerpent was by Gods appointment lifted up in the wilderneſſe, that whoſoever looked on him might be healed of the mortal bites of the fiery ſerpent and live: ſo is the Sonne of man lifted up, that whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have everlaſting life, by Gods appointment in like manner, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. 3. That as the ſerpent was not lifted up to deſtroy any of the people (for they were mortally wounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but to heale them: ſo Chriſt was not ſent into the world to condemn the world (for they are condemned already) but to ſave them. <hi>v.</hi> 17. 4. Yet they that looked not on the ſerpent ſo lifted up, did thereby procure unto themſelves a certaine death (becauſe it was to be abſolutely unavoydable by any other means whatſoever:) ſo they that beleeve not on the Sonne of God, but love darkneſſe rather then light, do thereby procure to themſelves certaine and remedileſſe condemnation, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 19. There remaining no more ſacrifice for ſin, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. Hence I deduce theſe four Corollaries. 1. That condemnation lyes upon all men, (without difference) for ſin. 2. Yet there is a remedy and way of eſcape from this condemnation revealed in the Goſpel. 3. That the way to eſcape condemnation, is to beleeve on Jeſus Chriſt. 4. The contempt of Chriſt by poſitive unbelief, makes condemnation unavoidable. <hi>Ergo,</hi> every man in the world, whiles an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, or ſo long as he continues in unbelief, is under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Text which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> brings in for illuſtration,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Joh</hi> 8. 24. If you beleeve not, you ſhall die in your ſins: I conſent to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> interpretation, that the meaning is; if you beleeve not at all, or if you never beleeve, you ſhall die in your ſins. And it informes us in the truth of thoſe two things, which I have been hitherto contending for. 1. That becauſe of their ſins, they became lyable to eternall death. 2. That yet their condemnation was not peremptory and irrevocable, unleſſe to all their other ſins they added unbelief final; for if at any time they did beleeve, they ſhould eſcape that wrath which was due to them for ſinne. As when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>Act. 27. 31. Except theſe men abide in the ſhip, you cannot be ſaved.</hi> He ſhews them that they were in eminent danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:116045:86"/> in the waters: and yet that they might be ſafe enough if the men aforeſaid continued in the ſhip. That place therefore makes againſt Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> altogether.</p>

                  <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> we muſt a little enquire what is his meaning,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> when he ſays that beleevers were children of wrath, namely by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or in reference to their ſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> and againe, that conſidered in themſelves, and as they come from the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> they are ſinful and curſed creatures. Which being to be underſtood in a diminutive ſenſe only, &amp; <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> (for Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not allow us to inferre, that becauſe they are under wrath by nature, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are under wrath ſimply: nor becauſe they are curſed in themſelves, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are curſed ſimply) muſt therefore be extended no farther, then may conſiſt with a ſtate of bleſſedneſſe and freedom from wrath, which the ſame perſons are in at the ſame time. And ſo the meaning is, that there is in every man (even the elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) naturally, and as they are the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſufficient ground and matter of condemnation: though they never ſtand actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally condemned (either in reſpect of their obligation to, or the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of puniſhment) becauſe of the grace of God preventing and hindring it. Even as he ſaid before, that the Law condemned the elect (whom yet he denies to be ever condemned ſimply) by the word <hi>condemneth</hi> (a verbe of active ſignification) expreſſing, not the effect which the Law produceth (for it is impoſſible men ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and not condemned both at once) but the faculty, power
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:116045:87"/> and virtue that is in the Law to condemne ſinners, if the Act of it were not hindred and bound up by grace. Thus do we often ſpeak in ordinary diſcourſe, as when we ſay <hi>Rhubarbe</hi> purgeth <hi>Choler:</hi> not relating to the actual operation of it (though the verb be of active ſignification) but to the virtue of it for ſuch an operation: and light makes all things manifeſt: relating ſtill to the faculty and property of it, not to the Act or exerciſe: for the words may be ſpoken at midnight. And as in theſe and the like expreſſions, the verbe active ſignifieth, not the Act or preſent influx of the cauſe, but the power and virtue of it: ſo when it is ſaid, that a man is accurſed, condemned in himſelf, or by nature, or the like; the verbs paſſive do not note the effect wrought and exiſting, but the morall capacity of a perſon to be the object of condemnation: nothing on his part hindring it, but rather preparing and diſpoſing him for it.</p>
                  <p>This (if any thing) being Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe, we are next to ſhew<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> that it is altogether inconſiſtent with the Apoſtles meaning in this text. And that appears. 1. From that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, we <hi>are</hi> the children of wrath by nature: but, we <hi>were</hi> the children of wrath by nature, namely in times paſt, as he doth twice expreſſe himſelfe, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. plainly oppoſing the time preſent to the time paſt, wherein they were children of wrath, but now were ceaſed to be ſo. Whereas, according to the ſenſe which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> puts upon the words, it is impoſſible that a ſinner ſhould be delivered from being a child of wrath, either in this world or in the world to come. Even glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints, conſidered according to what they are by nature, or in themſelves, or in reference to their ſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and ſo they remaine to all eternity. 2. The phraſe here uſed (as <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerves) <hi>children of wrath,</hi> is borrowed from the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> who are wont to call him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a ſonne of death, who is deſigned or adjudged to die, or hath contracted upon himſelf an obligation unto death, without any preſent actuall reverſion: as he that is found guilty of ſtripes, and adjudged to be beaten, is called a ſonne of ſtripes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 2. ſee alſo 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 31. and 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 5. Pſal.</hi> 102. 20. Therefore the ſame phraſe applied here to the elect in their unbelief, notes, that they were then under ſuch an ordination to death, as did exclude their preſent (<note n="d" place="margin">C ram Deo damnati. Calvin</note>) pardon and abſolution: They that were pardoned, were children of life, not of death. 3. We were alſo children of wrath (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>even as others.</hi> Will it be ſaid that all the world are children of wrath by nature; but by grace juſtified, and children of life at the ſame time?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:116045:88"/> If not, it muſt be yeelded that the elect and reprobate are both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually under the ſame condemnation, both equally obnoxious to eternall puniſhment, ſo long as they continue equally in a natural unregenerate condition. 4. The parallel place before-mentioned, <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And you being dead in your ſinnes, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, having forgiven you all your treſpaſſes. Beleevers then themſelves were ſometimes dead, that is, under condemnation, and ſo under it, as that they were then without remiſſion of ſins, for their quickning is by remiſſion: and nothing is quickned except it be dead.</p>
                  <p>That the elect, though children of wrath by nature, may yet at the<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> ſame time be the objects of love, is nothing to the purpoſe, till that love be proved to be their juſtification: which we have before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. 2. That the elect are called the children of God before converſion; I cannot conceive how it is proved from any or all the texts mentioned: if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had formed any Argument from them, it ſhould have had an anſwer. Nevertheleſſe, I acknowledge that elſewhere in Scripture they are ſo called, but metonymically: not becauſe they are children properly (for the relation of father and children, ſuppoſeth the exiſtence of the terms on both ſides related: take away one, and the other alſo is taken away); but becauſe they were deſigned and predeſtinated to be children: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. Having predeſtinated us to the Adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf. Even as the Lord tells <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 18. 10. That he had much people in <hi>Corinth:</hi> that is, many who were to be made his people by <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſtery, though before they were not his people, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. And as God calls <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſhepherd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 28. Two hundred years before he was borne: becauſe he was deſigned to ſuch an employment: and ſo he is called, not from what he was, but from what he was to be: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, others ſometimes are named, not from what they are, but from what they had been in times paſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 31. Publicans and harlots enter into the Kingdom of God before you: that is, ſuch as had been ſo. 3. That it is the good pleaſure of God, and not any inherent quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But it ſhould have been proved, that the ſaid good pleaſure of God makes us his children without any inherent qualifications in us. The Scriptures tell us that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:116045:88"/> we are the children of God by faith. <hi>Joh. 1. 12. Gal.</hi> 3. 26. and 4. 5. &amp;c. 4. I alſo yeeld that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to infants though they know it not: and that ſo it is alſo to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of grown Chriſtians. But it ſhould be proved that ſuch infants are uncapable of the habit of faith: or that their parents faith doth not ſupply their incapacity, as to their juſtification: of which more hereafter.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the firſt ſenſe be a Scripture-ſenſe, why have we not one word of Scripture to juſtifie it? The reaſon's ready, becauſe that will of God, which we are wont to call Reprobation, is neither wrath, nor an Act of wrath in Scripture language. 2. When Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> grants that the elect are ſubject to the threatnings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Law, he explaines himſelf thus. <q>The threatnings of the Law do ſeize upon and arreſt their conſciences as well as others: the Law as a rigid Schoole-maſter, doth never leave to whip and laſh them untill they fly unto Chriſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I asked then. 1. Whether that paine and anguiſh of Spirit which the elect (whiles unbeleevers) feele, be any part of the evil threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law? If it be (as moſt undoubtedly it is) then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> contradicts himſelf in ſaying the elect are under the threatnings of the Law, but not under the execution of them. If it be not, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf againe, in ſaying the Law doth whip and laſh them. It is not the Law that torments them, but ſomewhat elſe (what it is I cannot tell) if their torment be none of that evil which the Law threatneth. 2. I would ask alſo, what power there is in theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Law to make them fly to Chriſt? If by repreſenting to them that they are under condemnation till they lay hold on Chriſt by faith, then they are under condemnation till they believe: which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not heare of. If only that they are damnable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as he doth afterwards expreſſe himſelf) they are as lyable to ſuch an arreſt of the Law, after they believe, as before, even by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> conceſſion. And that word is not like to move a ſinner very haſtily to ſeek a change of his condition, which will purſue him as much after his condition is changed as before.</p>
                  <p>When it is ſaid that the elect are never under the execution of the<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> threatnings of the Law, that is, that the puniſhments threatned in the Law, are never executed upon them; if it be meant of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments reſerved to the world to come, it is true: but if it be meant of thoſe which are proper to this life, it is utterly falſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 17. and 47. 6. and 54. 7, 8. <hi>Job 36. 7, 11, 12.

                  <p>Now to what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, that the Law doth only declare who<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> are damnable in themſelves, not who are condemned of God, it is contrary, 1. To himſelf. 2. To ſenſe. 3. To reaſon.</p>
                  <p>1. To himſelf: for remember (Reader) that I brought in this place as an explication of that in <hi>Joh. 3. 18. He that beleeveth not, is condemned already.</hi> Which condemnation Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acknowledged to be by the Law, (and makes it the condemnation of finall unbelievers <hi>onely</hi>) I did rightly infer; if the condemnation there ſpoken of be that which is by the Law, then is it condemnation before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. (and not in conſcience only: which was the thing I was there proving.) To this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells me, the Law ſhews not who are condemned of God, but who are damnable in themſelves. How? hath it already condemned, and that reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſly, the greateſt part of the world, and yet doth it no more then ſhew who are damnable in themſelves; not, who are condemned of God? me thinks he ſhould at laſt ſuſpect the truth of that cauſe, which doth ſo often daſh him upon contradictions. 2. To ſenſe: for I appeale to the experience of all Chriſtians, who have felt the work of the Law driving them out of themſelves to fly unto Chriſt, whether it have not convinced them, not only that they are damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in themſelves (for that it will do after they are in Chriſt as well as before) but that they are (while out of Chriſt) condemned; that is, under an obligation and tendency to the ſuffering of wrath, and out of a ſtate of ſalvation. That it doth, ſo is manifeſt from the firſt queſtion, which a ſoul, upon whom the Law comes with power, will aske, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Act. 2, 37. and 16. 30. A queſtion which ſuppoſeth him to be convinced by the Law that he is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:116045:90"/> a condemned creature: needing, not only comfort, but ſalvation, that is, deliverance from condemnation, in which only he can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. Now if this be the worke of the Law, when brought home by the power of God; then muſt it needs be moſt true that ſuch a ſoul is indeed in the ſtate of condemnation, till by faith he be paſſed from death to life: and accordingly the Law muſt be acknowledged to declare not only who are damnable in themſelves, but who are condemned of God.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo againſt reaſon: for demonſtration of which we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> what it is for a man to be damnable in himſelf? It implies that there is on his part, ſufficient cauſe of condemnation, though he be not actually condemned, for want of the concurrence of ſome other cauſe; but what that actuall condemnation is, which is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be excluded, we muſt farther enquire. Condemnation (which we are forced often to obſerve) ſignifies either the ſinners obligation to puniſhment, or the execution of puniſhment: in the former ſenſe he is condemned, who by the Law is guilty of death: in the latter ſenſe, he who is actually damned, and ſuffers the puniſhment threatned. In diſtinction from one or both of theſe it is, that a man is ſaid to be <hi>damnable in himſelf:</hi> If from the former, the meaning is this: That all the world (the elect and all) have wrought that evill which were moſt ſufficient to work the forfeiture of their right to life, and make them lyable to eternal death, if there were any Law in force againſt them. If this be the ſenſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have the Apoſtle ſpeak in, when he ſayes all the world is become guilty before God, marke what follows. 1. Then the Law nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor ever did condemn any man living: for men are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be damnable, and but damnable, not actually condemned, for want of a Law in ſorce to condemn them, that is, to hold them under an obligation to puniſhment. The Law doth but ſhew its teeth (pardon the expreſſion reader) but it neither doth, nor ever did <hi>bite</hi> any man, no not the moſt preſumptuous tranſgreſſours of it: though tranſgreſſours be as fit objects as can be for the Law to take hold of, if it had power ſo to do. Hence, ſecondly, I would ask whether ever God did condemn any man: If he did, by what Act? not by the Law: that ſhews indeed who are damnable in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not who are condemned of God. I ſuppoſe it will be ſaid, that ſome are condemned by the eternall Act of Reprobation. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut I leave it to Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to prove, that the name or nature of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can agree to that Act according to Scripture: which if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:116045:91"/> prove, (as ſure enough he cannot, nor all the men on earth) it muſt needs follow, that there is no ſuch thing as the condemnation of any man, according to Scripture. Againſt this ſenſe of the text I could adde much more, if I could perſwade my ſelf to think that it were needful, for the help of any man.</p>
                  <p>But it may be this damnability is oppoſed to damnation executed;<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> and then the meaning is, That the Law doth not ſhew whom God damneth, (that is, puniſheth with damnation) but who are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable or puniſhable in themſelves, if God ſhould try and judge them according to the Law. But 1. This is nothing to the purpoſe. It is no part of my undertaking, to prove, that every one who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is an unbeliever, is damned, as that word notes the execution of damnation, or wrath actually inflicted: but that he is condemned, that is, under a legal obligation to puniſhment, till ſome gracious act of God diſcharge him. When therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> oppoſeth, that men are not condemned by the Law, but damnable; he fights with a ſhadow: for he that is damnable (executively) is condemned (legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) which is that I am proving: for it is the work of judgement to execute Laws, and to give to every man according to what is due to him by Law: if then, upon ſuppoſition that men were to be tried and judged by the Law of works, they would be found damnable: it muſt be alſo ſuppoſed, that they were before obliged by Law to the ſuffering of damnation. 2. Otherwiſe the Law is but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe of a Law, and called a Law equivocally, as we call a dead man a man: for example. There was a Law in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever ſhould not humble himſelf upon the day of expiation, ſhould be cut off Lev.</hi> 16. which Law is now abrogated. Nevertheleſſe, it may be truly ſaid, that if a Jew, who now keeps not that day, were to be tried and judged by that Law, he would be found puniſhable. If it be ſaid, that Law is now abrogated, and ſo no man incurres the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, upon the non-obſervance of it; It is moſt true, yet may he be ſaid to be puniſhable by it <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> in the very ſame ſenſe in which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> allows ſinners to be damnable by the Law of works, namely, upon ſuppoſition it were in force to make the penalty due, and ſinners were to be tried and judged by it. 3. And was it not worth the while, for the Lord Jeſus to come down from heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem ſinners from the curſe of the Law, and that at no eaſier a rate, then by being made a curſe for them, when the Law never curſed or condemned any man, but only ſhews who are damnable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they ſhould be judged by the Law? From which way of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:116045:91"/> judgement, the Elect are ſuppoſed to be ſecured by an antecedent act of God.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. cannot be meant meerly of condemnation in conſcience; was this. The condemnation of an unbelievers conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is either true, or falſe If true, then it is according to the judgement of God, and ſpeaks as the thing is, and ſo God condemns as well as the conſcience. If falſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>There is a threefold act of conſcience about ſin. 1. When it witneſſeth to us about the deſart of ſin. 2. When it witneſſeth to us concerning the act of ſin. 3. When it witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to us concerning our final ſtate and condition before God. Now if conſcience bear witneſſe to a man concerning what he hath done, and what is his deſart in ſo doing, it doth but its duty. But if it tell a man, that for the ſins which he hath done he is a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned creature, and muſt periſh everlaſtingly; ſuch a conſcience is both penally and ſinfully evil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Argument is wholly untouched. For the queſtion is not, whether an unbelievers conſcience condemn him truly in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his final eſtate: but whether it condemn him truly in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his preſent ſtate? If it tell him, that at preſent he is in a ſtate of condemnation, doth it ſpeak true, or falſe? Herein Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not anſwer me, but ſaith only, that if it tell him his caſe is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and without hope, it ſpeaks falſe. I need not tell Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> that his anſwer is impertinent: I am perſwaded he knows it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, conſcience may tell an unbeliever that he is condemned (and herein it ſpeaketh true) though it do not tell him that there is no way of coming out of this ſtate of condemnation, (which were falſe.) 2. The two former anſwers alſo are not much to purpoſe: for to witneſſe concerning the act and deſart of ſin, is as proper to the conſcience of a believer as of an unbeliever: whereas our queſtion is only concerning the unbelievers conſcience. And if this be the whole of what conſcience can juſtly charge upon an unbeliever, then is the believer as much ſubject to condemnation of conſcience, as the unbeliever.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. was not to be meant of condemnation in conſcience only, was, becauſe it is called the wrath which ſhall abide on unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>ver.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>Therefore we ſay, no elect unbeliever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of God, becauſe the wrath of God doth not abide upon him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> It is yielded then, that the condemnation about which we diſpute, is not meerly condemnation in conſcience, which is as much as I ever ſought from the place: and that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. 2. We have ſhewed before that the wrath of God is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one that is an unbeliever at preſent, though it do not abide upon any but final unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, thus I argued. The condemnation here ſpoken of, is oppoſed<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> to ſalvation, <hi>v. 17. Ergo,</hi> it is more then condemnation in conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That the condemnation oppoſed to ſalvation, is damnation: and then, by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Argument, the Elect, becauſe they are ſometimes unbelievers, muſt all be damned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Sure, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> believes not our Engliſh Proverb. As good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit as never the better. Salvation is ſometimes taken ſtrictly for an executive deliverance from wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. And ſo none are ſaved in this life. Sometimes more largely, and ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines both that compleat ſalvation, and the beginnings of it in this life, <hi>viz.</hi> that right which is given us to it in our Juſtification, <hi>Luke 19. 9. Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17. and 10. 9, 10. He that beleeveth not, is under condemnation, as it is oppoſed to ſalvation in the latter ſenſe. The ſecond anſwer is replied to already.</p>

But it may be he intends to deny Juſtification to be included in the Promiſe of not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, but having eternal life. Let us try it.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond anſwer therefore is, <q>The ſtinging of the fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, did plainly ſhadow forth the effects of the Law in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now as the Iſraelites when they were ſtung by thoſe fiery Serpents, found no eaſe till they looked up unto the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:116045:93"/> ſo the ſoule that is ſmitten and wounded by the Miniſtry of the Law, will never finde reſt, till it look unto him, in whoſe wounds and ſtripes is the healing of ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The effects of the Law in conſcience might very well be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> forth by the ſtinging of the fiery Serpents, as part of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which is due to ſinners: but that it ſhould repreſent no more is ſpoken <hi>gratis.</hi> Sin ſtings, becauſe it kills the perſon, as well as becauſe it diſquiets the conſcience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56. and a fiery ſting it is, becauſe it makes the ſinner obnoxious to the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, who is a conſuming fire, and whoſe wrath burnes to the very bottome of hell: not in the conſcience only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but upon the whole perſon, unleſſe it be prevented by faith and repentance. 2. Obſerve alſo (Reader) how Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is conſtrained to mince the matter, that he may make his Interpretation the more current. The Iſraelites (ſaith he) being ſtung of the fiery Serpents, could find no eaſe till they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looked up to the brazen Serpent. As if their wound had been only <hi>painful,</hi> but not <hi>mortal.</hi> And as if they had looked up to the brazen Serpent, not for life, but only for eaſe; whereas they were all mortally ſtung; many died actually, all had received their deaths wound, death was begun upon them all, and would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably have grown on to the laſt and utmoſt degree, if it had not been prevented by the brazen Serpent. To teach us, (though Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not learn it) that every unbeliever is in a ſtate of death and condemnation, nor can eſcape the laſt and ſoreſt part of this death, but by looking up to Jeſus Chriſt. 3. The reddition of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, in our Lords words. <hi>So muſt the Sonne of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life:</hi> which according to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe is this, <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeveth on him, ſhould not be diſquieted in conſcience, but ſhould have reſt and eaſe in his Spirit.</hi> This indeed, for the moſt part, doth in ſome meaſure follow upon our Juſtification, (as no doubt, but the Iſraelites recovered life and eaſe together). But to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from periſhing, and to have everlaſting life, (in right or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion) is ſurely more then to have eaſe from preſent anguiſh of ſpirit. Should I take this liberty of interpreting Scripture, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> might juſtly have been angry with my forehead.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells his Reader, that this very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> makes againſt me (I had need look to that). But how doth it make againſt me?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As (ſaith he) the Iſraelites were alive when they looked upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116045:93"/> the brazen Serpent (elſe they could not have ſeen it): ſo they that look upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>i, e.</hi> beleeve in him, are ſpiritually alive, or elſe they could not put forth ſuch a vital act.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But wherein doth this make againſt me? The moſt that follows from hence is, either that the habit of faith is before the act, as the faculty of ſight before the operation of it (which is no part of the Queſtion between Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> and me) or that a man is quickened internally by faith, before he is quickened morally by Juſtification and pardon; even as they put forth the vital act of ſeeing, before they received that healing which prevented their approaching death: which is the very thing I am proving. 2. But in every ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude there is ſome diſſimilitude: and if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will inſtance in things that do not come into the compariſon, he may as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that faith is an act of natural power; becauſe their look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the brazen Serpent (which repreſented faith) was ſo. I ſay therefore, that they that were ſtung with the fiery Serpents, though they were not dead, as to the utmoſt and laſt act of death, which conſiſts in the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body: yet they were dead in effect, and as much as the nature of the type, and the ſcope of the compariſon requires; as having received their deaths wound: which would ſoon have prevailed over the remainders of their life, if it had not been prevented by looking up to the brazen Serpent. And therefore of him that looked on the Serpent of braſſe, 'tis ſaid that he lived, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That is, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) he had eaſe from his anguiſh. And<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> ſo by looking up to Chriſt by faith, we finde eaſe and reſt to our wearied ſoules.</q> A man is ſaid to live when he lives comfortably and happily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Which is neither true in the Propoſition, nor Reddition of the compariſon. Not in the firſt: for in the type, the oppoſition is not between eaſe and paine. but between life and death, <hi>Numb. 21. 6. The fiery Serpents bit the people, and much people of Iſrael died,</hi> and <hi>ver. 9. It came to paſſe, that if a Serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the Serpent of braſſe he lived;</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is ſaid to live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 21. when he recovered of a mortal diſeaſe: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the pain and anguiſh of it, but principally from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of it. Nor in the ſecond: for though life in Scripture may ſometimes ſignifie a happy, proſperous and comfortable life; yet in our Saviours uſe of it, it hath not that ſenſe preciſely (though that may very well be included conſequently) partly, becauſe the life
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116045:94"/> obtained by looking up to Chriſt is oppoſed (not to pain and ſickneſs preciſely, but) to the death and deſtruction of the whole perſon, <hi>John 3. 15. The Sonne of man muſt be lifted up, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame life is called ſalvation, <hi>ver. 17. God ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Now though a man may be ſaid to live, when he lives comfortably, yet he is never ſaid to be ſaved in Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, becauſe he lives comfortably. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>Now we live, if ye ſtand faſt, 1 Theſ.</hi> 3. 8. I think he is to be underſtood of a joyful comfortable life. But it had been very uncouth to expreſſe the ſame life thus. <hi>Now we are ſaved, if ye ſtand faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath a ſad quarrel againſt me for reading that<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> text, <hi>John</hi> 6. 40. thus. <hi>It is the Will of God, that he that ſeeth and beleeveth the Sonne ſhall be juſtified;</hi> whereas the words are, <hi>That whoſoever ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeveth on him, may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> Herein he ſaith, I have corrupted and falſified the text.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> What you pleaſe Sir: provided you take in all manner of Commentators as well as my ſelfe; for I know no man but you, that excludes Juſtification from being there contained in eternal life. As when the Law ſayes, <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt live;</hi> the life promiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Juſtification primarily: ſo when it is ſaid, <hi>He that believes ſhall have eternal life;</hi> life includes Juſtification in like manner. And though there be many more bleſſings included, then that ſingle one of Juſtification: yet that only being to my purpoſe, I thought I might mention it only, without being guilty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I had thought alſo, the believer may be ſaid to have eternal life in right, as well as in poſſeſſion; as the Lord ſpeaks a little below, <hi>ver. 47. He that believeth on me, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> And to have right to life, or life in right, is to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: and therefore is our Juſtification called Juſtification of life, <hi>Rom. 5. 18.

                  <p>THe next compariſon I made uſe of for illuſtration and proof<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> of this matter, was out of <hi>John</hi> 6. 51, 52, 53, 54. where faith is compared to eating, and Juſtification to the nouriſhment we receive by our meat. As then we are not firſt nouriſhed, and then eat the meat that nouriſheth us, but we eat our meat that we may be nouriſhed by it: ſo neither are we firſt juſtified, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Chriſt that hath juſtified us, but we beleeve in Chriſt that we may be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That this is a miſtake like the former: for it is Chriſt himſelf, who throughout that Chapter is compared to bread and food:</q> whom by faith we receive for our refreſhment, conſolation and ſpiritual nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> As if Juſtification were none of that nouriſhment which we receive by faith, becauſe Chriſt himſelf is the meat on whom we feed! This anſwer is a plain yielding of the Argument, unleſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> intend, that it is only comfort and refreſhment, and not Juſtification and pardon, which is the nouriſhment we receive by feeding on Chriſt; which if he doth intend, we oppoſe from the text. 1. That Chriſt invites us to eat of his fleſh that we may live; not ſimply that we may be refreſhed and comforted; its in vain to talk of refreſhing and comforting him that is dead, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. The bread of God giveth life to the world, the very ſubſtance and being of life, not only the well-being, which conſiſts in refreſhment and conſolation. And though life may now and then, (though very rarely) ſignifie preciſely a comfortable life, yet here ſurely it ſignifies more; as being oppoſed to eternal death, under which the world is ſuppoſed to be till Chriſt give them life, <hi>ver. 50. (to be,</hi> I mean, in reſpect of guilt) and that very life, in the loſſe of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the whole miſery of unbelievers, <hi>ver. 53. Except you eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</hi> 2. And that Juſtification or pardon of ſin, is ſo far from being excluded, as that indeed it is the principal bleſſing included in the life here promiſed, is manifeſt from the Lords own words (almoſt the very ſame with thoſe uſed throughout this chapter) in adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Supper. <hi>This is my body which is broken for you,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:116045:95"/> hath it, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 24.) This is my blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. <hi>Ergo,</hi> remiſſion of ſins is that life which the fleſh and blood of Chriſt gives to the world. 3. The life mentioned throughout the chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all the bleſſings which Chriſt hath purchaſed for believers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it containes Juſtification and pardon of ſins, or elſe Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver purchaſed that for them. If it be ſaid, that Chriſt purchaſed not the act of pardon, but that conſolation and refreſhment which is the effect of it: we have already ſhewed, that neither is that act wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of pardon, which cannot of it ſelf produce the effects of pardon: nor was it needful, that where pardon is, ſo great a price ſhould be paid for the effects of it. What can hinder good things from us but ſin? and ſin, if it be pardoned, can no more hinder then if it never had been committed: that there would be no need for Chriſt to die, to purchaſe any good things for us, if he do not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the very act of pardon. 4. The life which the fleſh and blood of Chriſt gives to the world, is not life ſimply, but ſalvation from periſhing; as appears, by comparing <hi>ver.</hi> 40. with <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17. therefore ſurely containes more then a life of comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preciſely, as was before obſerved. 5. And I leave it with Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to conſider, whether there be not ſome greater malignity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grace of God, and ſalvation by Chriſt in his opinion, then in the doctrine of thoſe whom he oppoſeth (pretendedly as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to grace,) when for the maintaining of it, he is forced to bear us in hand, that God ſent not Chriſt, nor did Chriſt come <hi>to quicken a dead world,</hi> but to give eaſe to a ſick world, or healing to a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world: not to give life to them that were dead, but comfort and refreſhment to them that were alive; or not to reſtore them unto life, but to continue and perfect them in the life they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Eph. 2. 5. You that were dead in ſins hath he quickened;</hi> namely, by remiſſion, <hi>Col. 2. 13. If one died for all, then were all dead, 2 Cor. 5. 15. Ergo,</hi> a leſſer matter then the death of Chriſt wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY fourth general Argument, proving faith to go before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> was this: What place and order works had to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification in the Covenant of works, the ſame place and order faith hath to our Juſtification in the Covenant of grace.

My meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Propoſition is this. That as by the Covenant of works it was required that men ſhould fulfil the Law, that they might be juſtified; ſo by the Goſpel it is required, that men beleeve, that they may be juſtified: faith goes before Juſtification here, as works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it there.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I deny the conſequence. What manner of Readers did Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> promiſe himſelf, when he puts down ſuch ſayings as theſe, without one word or pretence of proof? that which made works man's perfect righteouſneſſe, was not the place and order which they had by the Covenant to his Juſtification: but their own eſſential natural perfection, as being a punctual and exact conformity to the rule of his Creation: the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of that rule of Divinity, which by Creation was implanted in the frame of mans nature. That it was the condition of his Juſtification, was <hi>ex accidenti;</hi> by vertue of the Covenant, promiſing a reward of life upon the doing of ſuch works. May not therefore faith have the ſame place and order, that is, be in like manner the condition of the Juſtification of a ſinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not mans natural perfect righteouſneſſe? <hi>Titius</hi> will let <hi>Sempronius</hi> have a farme, if he will give him to the worth of it: He lets <hi>Maeveus</hi> have another, if he will ask him for it. Here, <hi>ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is the condition: there, the payment of the full price: both have the ſame place and order to the obtaining of the farme: yet ſurely begging is not the payment of the full price.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> 4. <q>Then is the ſecond Covenant a Covenant of works:<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> ſeeing faith is a work of ours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have already ſhewed at large, that the grace or act of faith, is perpetually oppoſed to works in Scripture-language. 2. However this Argument is inconſequent; for it will by no means follow, that if faith have the ſame place and order in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as works in the old, then the New Covenant is a Covenant of works. Suppoſe God had made the world a promiſe of pardon, upon the condition of the exiſtence of ſome contingent event, <hi>v. g.</hi> That if <hi>Paul</hi> be converted within ſeven years after Chriſts Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, all the world ſhall be juſtified. <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion in this caſe, would have the very ſame place and order to the Juſtification of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:116045:97"/> the world, as workes had in the old Covenant (though it be not a condition of the ſame nature and quality) yet ſurely this latter promiſe could not therefore be proved to be a Covenant of workes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>M. <hi>Eyre.</hi> 5. This aſſertion makes faith to be not of grace, becauſe not from the Covenant of grace, ſeeing the Covenant it ſelf depends on it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This aſſertion ſuppoſeth that nothing can be of grace, which is not by the Covenant of grace, Was not the Covenant it ſelf of grace? 2. Of the dependance of faith upon the Covenant, &amp; of the Covenant upon faith, we diſpute purpoſely below. Here we ſpeak only of one bleſſing of the Covenant, namely juſtification. And as ſoon as ever Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath proved that faith cannot be given us of grace, if it be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of juſtification; I will write a book of retractations as long as <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> if I live to it. In the mean time he deals not like a diſputant to charge ſuch a conſequence upon us, and never go about to prove it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he ſuggeſts to his reader that my propoſition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Proteſtants, 'tis a vaine and empty flouriſh (to ſpeak the beſt of it.)

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. <q>That <hi>Beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> is not the tenor of the new Covenant, for. 1. It's no where called ſo. 2.

Not the Covenant of the Law: for the Apoſtle expreſly oppoſeth them againſt that Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 6. a third Covenant they cannot be. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee upon what grounds Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies theſe words,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> to be the tenor of the new Covenant. 1. <q>Saith he, they are no where called ſo.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nor doth the <hi>name</hi> of the Covenant of workes appeare in Scripture (nor of the Covenant of grace neither) is it therefore a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to deny that <hi>do this and live</hi> is the tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes? 2. If it be not called by the name of the Covenant, yet is it called by names of equipollent ſignification: as when it is called the Goſpel, the word of faith, the righteouſneſſe of faith, the Law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. the Law of righteouſneſſe, 9. 31. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Heb. 4. 1. Gal.</hi> 3. 22. 3. But neither is the name wanting. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. If it be but a mans Covenant, no man diſannulleth or addeth thereto. Now to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were the promiſes made—And the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, &amp;c. Compare theſe expreſſions with, <hi>v.</hi> 22. [But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe, And <hi>v.</hi> 14. [That the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith:] And <hi>v.</hi> 9. [So then, they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithfull <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>] Hence the Argument is. The promiſe of bleſſedneſſe through faith, is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the new Covenant. <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> is the promiſe of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:116045:98"/> bleſſedneſſe through faith. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the new Covenant, or of the Covenant of grace. (Theſe two tearms I uſe as of the ſame import, to expreſſe that Covenant which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Covenant of workes ſtrictly ſo called.) The Minor is paſt denyall. The Major ſtands upon this foundation. That the ſame inheritance and bleſſing which was given by promiſe to beleeving <hi>Abraham</hi> (which promiſe is called the Covenant) is now propoſed to all the world, (Gentiles as well as Jews) to be obtained by the ſame faith that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and given to them when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſecond Argument, that when the new Covenant is mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. it runs quite in another ſtraine: I muſt deſire thee (Reader) to have pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath a ſpeciall reaſon, why this Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> 6, 9. cannot be the Covenant of grace, becauſe it requires confeſſion as well as faith: and ſo juſtification by the new Covenant would be juſtification by confeſſion, as well as by faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Apoſtle anſwers this fully, <hi>v.</hi> 10. With the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe: and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation. Hence it is manifeſt, that faith, and faith only, is requiſite to juſtification: but confeſſion alſo is required of them that are juſtified, unto ſalvation, according to what our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpeaks; whoſoever ſhall confeſſe me before men, him will I alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confeſſe before my Father: but whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father, <hi>Matth. 10. 32, 33. Luk.</hi> 12. 8. Indeed our compleat and final juſtification at the day of judgement, is no ſmall part of our ſalvation: but the Apoſtle here diſtinguiſhing juſtification as a thing going before, from ſalvation as a thing following after, teacheth us to underſtand him of our initial juſtification, or of the firſt right to the inheritance of life, which by the promiſe is given a man as ſoone as he believes; which yet is to be underſtood, not as if confeſſion were of as univerſal and abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, as faith it ſelf (for if a man believe in the very laſt moment of his life, when he hath neither opportunity, nor ability of body to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,

Nor finally, is confeſſion required as by it ſelf, and in coordination with faith, but as in ſubordination thereunto; being indeed the natural effect thereof, and that wherein the truth and life of faith doth exert it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>To what is added, that the Apoſtles ſcope is to anſwer that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> how a man may know that he ſhall be ſaved? and that he doth deſcribe the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, by two markes or characters, faith and confeſſion; I reply, we have been too often impoſed upon by pretended ſcopes: and Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> is falſly alledged as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the Apoſtles ſcope is to anſwer the foreſaid queſtion: for he ſaith it not: but is purpoſely arguing in that very place which <note n="m" place="margin">Sound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev. p. 230.</note> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> referres to, out of this very Text, that we are not juſtified before we beleeve. Yet is it moſt true, that a man may come by faith to know that he ſhall be ſaved: and the ground of it is, becauſe faith is appointed of God to be <hi>medium fruitionis,</hi> a means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation; and therefore cannot be denied to be <hi>medium cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> a means by which a man may know that he ſhall be ſaved. Even as the ſame Law which made workes the means of life, <hi>do this and live,</hi> if a man had kept it, would have alſo bred the aſſurance and knowledge that he ſhould have lived. But, 1. As it is not the knowledge of life ſimply, but life it ſelf which is promiſed in thoſe words (for it were too groſſe to paraphraſe them thus, do this, and thou ſhalt thereby know that thou ſhalt live) ſo it is not ſimply the knowledge of juſtification and ſalvation, but ſalvation it ſelf which is promiſed in theſe, <hi>beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is of the Law ſayes thus, do this and live, <hi>v.</hi> 5.

What will become of the Scriptures, if men may interpret them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rate? 3. And here (to ſee how it falls out) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is forced to contend, that the Apoſtle mentioneth faith as that which evidenceth juſtification as a mark or character: which way of eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing he could by no means approve of, when I urged it, <hi>p.</hi> 77. §. 3. and 4. of his book.</p>

And according to my promiſe there, I ſhall adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, that if it be poſſible Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> may ſuſpect the truth of that notion which he cannot defend, but by turning the Scriptures into a noſe of wax. And 1. I ſay, that if the foreſaid words do only deſcribe the perſons that ſhall be ſaved, then are they here uſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the like words or manner of ſpeech is uſed any where elſe in Scripture. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath not yet produced us one place, where ſuch phraſe of ſpeech is a bare deſcription of a perſon (at leaſt, unleſſe we will take his bare word that ſo it is meant:) And though it be hard to be peremptory in ſuch a nicety, and deny univerſally that there is any example in Scripture of ſuch phraſe of ſpeech uſed in ſuch a ſenſe; yet upon the moſt diligent and critical obſervation which I have made on purpoſe to diſcover it, I can find none, neither in the Old nor New-Teſtament, and therefore ſhall deny it, till Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> not only ſay it, but prove it. For if the foreſaid words, <hi>If thou beleeve thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> do only deſcribe what manner of perſons they are that ſhall be ſaved: then do they not ſuſpend ſalvation upon the act of beleeving, but their meaning is this, If thou be one of thoſe who be or ſhall be believers, thou ſhalt be ſaved. Shew us the like in all the Scriptures. And hence, 2. It follows, that theſe words do not preſent believers as ſuch (<hi>reduplicativè</hi>) as the objects of ſalvation: but only <hi>Specificativè,</hi> the men that are believers; but under ſome other reſpect and notion. For example, <hi>Peter</hi> gives a legacy to <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Tanner</hi> that lives in <hi>Joppa</hi> by the ſea ſide. The meſſenger that carries the legacy knows not the man, but tells him, if he be the Tanner of <hi>Joppa,</hi> this legacy is his. Which words do not indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the condition, but the deſcription of the Legatee from his place and profeſſion: and the legacy is not given him in reſpect of either of theſe circumſtances, but immediately as the perſon whom theſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116045:100"/> circumſtances deſcribe, or it is not given the man <hi>Quatenus</hi> he is a Tanner; but it is given the Tanner <hi>Quatenus</hi> he is the man whom <hi>Peter</hi> meant in his will. In like manner, when it is ſaid, <hi>if thou beleeve thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> if the meaning be this; if thou be one of them that do or ſhall believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved; then ſalvation pertaines not to men as believers, but to believers as men, under ſome other notion and capacity. And that muſt be either. 1. As they are men ſimply, or, 2. As they are ſinful men, or finally (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will ſay: for to affirme either of the former were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably abſurd) as they are elect. And ſo the iſſue will be this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>Quatenus</hi> they are elect (<hi>Specificativè</hi>) are the objects of ſalvation. Now ſee (Reader) what this will come to at the long runne. 1. Hereby is faith deveſted of all neceſſity, and uſefulneſſe in order to ſalvation, farther then it is a mark or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gne (as all other ſaving graces are) of a man that ſhall be ſaved. Even as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and place of the Tanner forementioned contributed nothing to his obtaining of <hi>Peters</hi> legacy: it ſerved only to deſcribe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom it was given. And is this that precious faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. more precious then gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. the Chriſtians riches, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. by which he obtaines and inherits promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. &amp; 6. 12. righteouſneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. ſalvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. and all good things whatſoever, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. ſo highly every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture, and urged upon ſuch tearms of neceſſity? How can we be ſaid to obtaine promiſes, righteouſneſſe, and ſalvation <hi>by faith,</hi> if faith ſerve only to deſcribe the perſon? It may be this new divinity will ſhortly produce a new Rhetorick: and that is no more then needs. 2. If the elect had been deſcribed by their names, parents, time and place of their birth and habitation, they might be ſaid to obtaine promiſes, righteouſneſſe, ſalvation by theſe as well as by ſaith, if there be no other neceſſity of faith to righteouſneſſe and ſalvation, then as it is a deſcription of the perſons that ſhall be ſaved. 3. And according to this gloſſe, there can be no ground of exhorting, beſeeching, and commanding ſinners to believe on and accept of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: no more then of exhorting, or commanding them to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as we have demonſtrated in the place before mentioned. 4. Nor have the words according to the ſame gloſſe, the forme and nature of a promiſe, but of a meer conne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e <hi>Axi me,</hi> affirming the conſequent upon ſuppoſition of the Antecedent. For, <hi>if thou beleeve,</hi> that is, if thou be ſuch a one as art or ſhalt be a believer, is but a periphraſis of election unto faith: for the down right meaning, without circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116045:100"/> is this. If thou be one of thoſe whom God from eternity purpoſed to make a believer, thou ſhalt be ſaved. And why? not becauſe of the Promiſe by which God hath obliged himſelf to give ſalvation upon their believing, who before had no right to it, (that will infer a conditional Promiſe, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> abhors) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that purpoſed the one, purpoſed the other alſo: and this he commanded to be declared and publiſhed to the world. And I ſay in like manner; If the Sun riſe, we ſhall have light upon the earth: and if God make ſtones the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they ſhall be able to ſpeak. But we know from the Scriptures, that the inheritance of life and ſalvation is given by Promiſe, <hi>Gal. 3. 18. Rom. 4. 13, 16, 20. Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 15. 5. And we know from the ſame Scriptures, that righteouſneſſe and ſalvation is not given to believers <hi>quatenus</hi> they are elect, but rather to the elect <hi>quatenus</hi> they are believers: that is, they are not only given to the men that are believers, but given to them as they are believers. It was <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> that <hi>was imputed to him unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 4. 3. <hi>and the Promiſe was to him and to his ſeed through faith,</hi> ver. 16.

Now I would ask, why it is called a reward? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will tell me, becauſe it follows faith. Be it ſo, (though I think there is much more in it.) But faith may be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either as an act required of us, or as the work of God in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. Now I would know, whether life and ſalvation be the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:116045:101"/> reward of faith as it is our act, or as it is Gods work? If the former, (as moſt certain,) then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> muſt quit his beloved gloſſe: for if ſalvation by the Promiſe, be made conſequent to faith, as an act required of us, and performed by us, then faith is the condition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we are entitled to ſalvation by the ſame Promiſe: and ſo ſalvation pertaines to us as believers <hi>formaliter,</hi> and not only as to the men, whoſe property and priviledge it is to be believers ſooner or later. If the ſecond be ſaid, namely, that ſalvation follows faith, and ſo is the reward thereof, as it is the work of God in us, then God rewards himſelf, he doth not reward us. Even as if I ſhould call Gods preſerving the world the reward of his creating it; or the deſtruction of the world the reward of his preſerving it: or his gloriſying our bodies, the reward of his raiſing them out of their graves: or his calling us unto faith the reward of his predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us: for each of theſe actions is conſequent to the foregoing. And yet I doubt not, but if a man ſhould talk after this rate, he would be accounted to utter ſtrange kinde of tropes. 7. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> may do well to remember that he hath yet given me no ſimilitude of Anſwer to the main Argument. When the Law ſayes, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> or, <hi>If thou do this, thou ſhalt live:</hi> or, <hi>He that doth theſe things ſhall live:</hi> all the world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY fifth and laſt Argument for the antecedency of faith to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> was aken from 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. Such were ſome of you; but you are waſhed, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> where there is an evident oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between the time paſt and preſent, in reſpect of their Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>That the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>In times paſt they were unſanctified:</hi> He doth not ſay they were unjuſtified before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The Apoſtle ſays neither the one nor the other in ſo many words: but if that which he doth ſay, will not infer that they were unjuſtified, as well as unſanctified, before the time he ſpeaks of, what can be thought of the Scriptures, but that they are a ſealed book, which no man can open? Compare the ninth verſe with this <hi>Know you not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God?—And ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are juſtified.</hi> The Apoſtle in the ſame verſe, having mentioned <hi>fornicatours, idolaters, &amp;c.</hi> addes, <hi>And ſuch were ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>me of you, but you are ſanctified.</hi> I appeal to common ſenſe, whether the former word will not as forcibly infer that they were unjuſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed in times paſt; as theſe latter, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied in times paſt? But the matter is too clear to be diſputed, that in their unconverted eſtate, there was a barre againſt their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Kingdom of God, which was now removed in their Juſtification. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They were before unjuſtified. Hence 2. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus. He that in the condition he is in, cannot enter into the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116045:102"/> Kingdome of God, he in that condition is not juſtified. Theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> in the condition they were in before their Converſion, could not enter into the Kingdome of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Theſe <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in their unconverted condition were not juſtified. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is the words of the text, <hi>No unrighteous can inherit the Kingdome of God.—And ſuch were ſome of you.</hi> The Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtands upon this ground, <hi>That he that is juſtified is an heire of the Kingdome:</hi> and therefore it is ſo far from being impoſſible, that being juſtified he ſhould inherit the Kingdome, as that he cannot be excluded from it without being diſinherited, <hi>Tit. 3. 7. That being juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made heires, according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> Compare <hi>Gal. 3. 26, 29. Rom. 8. 30. and</hi> 5. 17, 18, 21.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells us. 2. <q>That if any man will ſtrain<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> this conſequence from the words (<hi>ſtrain it?</hi>) then he will owne his former anſwer, That they were not juſtified before converſion <hi>in foro conſcientiae,</hi> or, <hi>in foro Eccleſiaſtico.</hi>

Which he doth well to profeſſe not to maintain, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition of the foreſaid inference; for if Juſtification here be meant, that which is in conſcience, or before the Church (which laſt member of the diſtinction we heard not of till now:) ſurely Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>'s principles will not permit him to account it a <hi>ſtraining;</hi> if a man ſhall infer that theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not juſtified in conſcience before, becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Now you are juſtified.</hi> 2.

The Argument but now mentioned here returnes. The Juſtification here ſpoken of, is that which gives right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:116045:102"/> Now that they were believers, their condition is altered in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; and in oppoſition to the former, he tells them <hi>they were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> and in oppoſition to the latter, <hi>they were juſtified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If when it is ſaid <hi>You are juſtified,</hi> it muſt be meant of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> manifeſted in conſcience, or in the Church: when it is ſaid, <hi>You are ſanctified,</hi> why ſhould not ſanctification be underſtood of that which is declared or manifeſted?</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> dilates upon the differences between Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Sanctification; and concludes, that when I ſay, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be alledged for Juſtification before beleeving, which will not hold as ſtrongly for ſanctification before beleeving: it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but my confidence to ſupport it. If I had ſaid, Nothing could be ſaid againſt ſanctification before beleeving, which will not hold as ſtrongly againſt Juſtification before believing, there had been the more appearance of reaſon for this cenſure: but as my words lay, I appeal to himſelf for judgement: for Juſtification before believing he layes theſe two foundations; namely, the eternal Will and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God to juſtifie, and our Juſtification in the death of Chriſt. And it cannot be denied, but that the Scriptures ſpeak every whit as much, concerning the Will of God to ſanctifie, <hi>Eph. 1. 4. 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. and of our Sanctification in the death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Col.</hi> 3. 3. Wherefore ſeeing this is all that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath to ſay for Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before faith, I was no more confident then true, in affirming, that as much might be ſaid for ſanctification before faith.</p>
                  <p>As to the differences which here he puts between Juſtification and<note place="margin">§. 19</note> Sanctification, I own them as readily as any man, (except what ſhall be below excepted.) As, 1. That the former is a work or act of God without us: the other is the operation of God within us, &amp;c.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:116045:103"/> who interprets Juſtification in ſuch a ſenſe? And if it be law: ful for him to fancy a diſtinction between the act and effects of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and obtrude it upon us without one ſyllable of Scripture to countenance it: let others be allowed on their own heads, to fancie ſome ſuch like diſtinction of ſanctification, and it will be a thing not worthy the name of a work or labour, to prove, that men are ſanctified (as well as juſtified) before they beleeve.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> puts between Juſtification and<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> Sanctification is this, <q>That the ſentence of Juſtification is terminated in conſcience:</q> but Sanctification is diffuſed throughout the whole man, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23.</p>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The intent and ſenſe of this, I own alſo. But 1. I reject the terme of Juſtification, <hi>terminated upon conſcience. Paſſio</hi> (as well as <hi>actio) eſt ſuppoſiti.</hi> It is the man, not his conſcience, which is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Again, the meaning of it is, that a mans Juſtification is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted or declared to him. But this manifeſtation is either by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation, and that is not to the conſcience (properly), but to the underſtanding: or by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit enabling the conſcience to conclude a mans Juſtification; and then it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that <hi>terminates,</hi> not upon which Juſtification <hi>is terminated.</hi> 2. Aſſurance by our Divines is wont to be made a part of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and may very well be included in the ſanctification of the <hi>Spirit, 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. as diſtinct from ſoule and body. If then the Juſtification ſpoken of here (and in other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) be our aſſurance that we are juſtified, then the diſtinction here propoſed between Juſtification and Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cation falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Argument which I mentioned, to prove, that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> here could not be meant of that which is in conſcience, is this. The Juſtification which they now had, was that which gave them right and title to the Kingdome of God, which right and title they had not before: for if they had this right before, then whether they believed or no, all was one, as to the certainty of their ſalvation: they might have gone to heaven, though they had lived and died without faith.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, 1. <q>The elect <hi>Corinthians</hi> had no more right to ſalvation after their beleeving, then they had before: for their right to ſalvation was grounded only upon the Purpoſe of God, and the Purchaſe of Chriſt. 2. Yet it will not follow, that they might have gone to heaven without faith: ſeeing Chriſt hath
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116045:103"/> purchaſed faith for his people no leſſe then glory: and God hath certainly appointed, that all that live to yeares of diſcretion, whom in his ſecret Juſtification he hath adjudged to life, ſhall have this evidence of faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The former anſwer is ſuch as I never read before, in any writings of God or man, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome men that live in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, idolatries, blaſphemies, murders, and all manner of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet have as much right to the Kingdome of Heaven, as the moſt faithful, humble, mortified, laborious Chriſtian or Apoſtle that lives upon the earth; the height of whoſe bleſſedneſſe it is, that they have right to enter into the Kingdome of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 14. If this bleſſedneſſe may be had in the ſervice of ſin and Satan, in the fulfilling of the luſts of the fleſh, and of the minde, in the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſſe; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow ſhall be as to day, and much better. 2. None have right to heaven, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a reward; wicked and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But let us examine the text: <hi>The unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God Be not deceived: neither fornicatours, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, &amp;c. ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God. And ſuch were ſome of you, but you are waſhed, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified.</hi> The inference in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative is this. <hi>Ergo,</hi> now they might and ſhould inherit the Kingdome. That which made them uncapable of inheriting the Kingdome before, was not only the filth of ſin (from which they were now waſhed in ſanctification) but the guilt of ſin, from which they were now alſo waſhed in Juſtification. Hence the firſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That Juſtification which waſheth away the guilt of ſin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the removal of which they were made capable of inheriting the Kingdome, that Juſtification gave them right to the Kingdome. But the Juſtification which they now had, and not before, was that which waſhed away the guilt of ſin, upon the removal of which they were capable of inheriting the Kingdom. <hi>Ergo,</hi> This Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that which gave them right to the Kingdom. The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is neceſſary, as conſiſting of termes immediately contrary. Guilt is <hi>obligatio ad poenam,</hi> an obligation to puniſhment: that which is contrary to it, and deſtroys or expels it, is a right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity: if the loſſe of heaven be part of that puniſhment to which they are obliged; that which is contrary to it and expells it, is a right to heaven. The Aſſumption is ſo plain in the text, as nothing more. Time was when you could not have inherited the Kingdome of God, becauſe of the fearful ſins you lived in; but now you are juſtified, and therefore may inherit it. 2. The ſame barre which lay againſt the entrance of other ſinners into the Kingdome of God, lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo. <hi>No fornicatours, idolaters, &amp;c. ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God. And ſuch were ſome of you. But ye are juſtified.</hi> But the want of Juſtification and pardon is a barre or hindrance againſt the entrance of other ſinners into the Kingdom of God. This, I think, will not be denied; and if it be, it is eaſily proved: becauſe the Juſtification of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> is mentioned
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:116045:104"/> by the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that which changed the caſe, and put the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and other Gentiles yet unconverted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their capability of inheriting the Kingdome. Now he that periſheth for want of Juſtification or pardon, periſheth but for want of a right to heaven: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he that may now inherit heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is juſtified, or by vertue of his Juſtification, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inherit it, becauſe he hath now a right to it by his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, that their right to ſalvation was<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> grounded only in Gods Purpoſe, and in Chriſts Purchaſe: I thought the Scriptures had mentioned a third, and a more immediate ground then either of theſe, and that is the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 18. a Promiſe made not only to them that be believers, but through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 16, 23, 24. though I confeſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is concerned to take but little notice of it; for if the right to heaven be given by the Promiſe, then they that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Promiſe (as theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſometimes no leſſe then the <hi>Epheſians; Eph.</hi> 2. 12.) are alſo without a right to heaven.

But the Purchaſe of Chriſt, (though it was made for our good, yet not in our names (for Chriſt in purchaſing, was neither our Mandatory, Proxie nor Delegate) and therefore gives right immediately to none, but by the intervention of that Covenant which was ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed in his blood, even the Promiſe through faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as we ſhall ſhew more particularly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

Partly and principally (which alſo is my ſecond Argument for proof of the conſequence) becauſe the right which is given a man to the Kingdome by Juſtification, according to Scriptures, is independent upon time, ſo that if he die the very next moment that he is juſtified, he ſhall and muſt be ſaved: yea, ſuch an immediate and neceſſary dependance there is of the Kingdome upon Juſtification, that nothing more is required to make a man morally and immediately capable of inheriting the Kingdome, but that he be juſtified, <hi>Rom. 8. 30.

It muſt be purpoſed either as a means to the obtaining of righteouſneſſe and life, (and then I have what I would; for then no man hath a right to heaven but by faith: and if any man hath right without it, the gift of faith as to them, in order to that end, is utterly needleſſe and ſuperfluous;) or it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as part of the natural eſſential perfection of mans nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he is reſtored by Chriſt: and this I deny: at leaſt, I am very doubtful of it, and deſire it may be proved. <note n="a" place="margin">

Faith it ſelfe therefore being no part of our inheritance, nor meanes of obtaining it upon Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſuppoſal, that it is no meanes of obtaining right to it, it remaines, that it is not neceſſary to any mans ſalvation: and then what ſhould hinder, but that men may be ſaved without it? 3. If this be the true reaſon why the elect in their ungodlineſſe cannot inherit heaven; though then they have right to it, namely, becauſe they have not that, as yet, which God is purpoſed to give them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go to heaven; then their incapacity of heaven, even while they live in all manner of wickedneſſe, is not at all privative or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but purely negative: that is, they are therefore uncapable of heaven, not becauſe the Law, or ſin, or any thing they do, deprives them of the poſſeſſion of heaven; but becauſe God hath not done what his purpoſe is to do, in all whom he intends to glorifie. Wilt thou ſee (Reader) what are the iſſues of this Goſpel? 1. Hereby ſin is made of a like neceſſity to the enjoyment of Heaven, as faith? for he that purpoſed to bring the elect to heaven, purpoſed alſo that they ſhould be ſinners, <hi>ipſo permittente,</hi> by his permiſſion: And ſo (for example) <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> while they were innocent, had a right to heaven, but they could not enjoy it till they had ſinned: becauſe he that purpoſed to give them heaven, purpoſed alſo to permit them firſt to ſin. 2. Yea, ſo far was ſin from being their hindrance, that it was their furtherance rather: for having ſinned, the more was over and paſt of thoſe things which God had appointed ſhould go before their ſalvation: and ſo by their ſin they became nearer heaven then they were before. 3. And on the contrary, the purpoſe of giving faith, is rather a hinderance then a furtherance of their happineſſe, for they have right to heaven even while they live in all manner of ungodlineſſe: only that which hinders their enjoyment is that there is a purpoſe of giving faith, which muſt be accompliſhed before they can inherit; were it not for that purpoſe they might go to heaven preſently, and as they are. 4. And that without all gain-ſaying of the Law: which though it be a bug-beare, even to the elect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to terrifie and affright the conſcience, while they live in ſin and ungodlineſſe; yet hath no authority (it ſeemes) to debarre them from entrance into heaven, no more then if it never had been violated.

This reaſon makes as much againſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute election before faith, as againſt abſolute juſtification. 3.

                  <p>To the ſecond I reply, That there is no compariſon between<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> election and juſtification, as is at large above demonſtrated. Let us ſet Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> parallel before us, that the diſſimilitude may the better appeare. Thus then he argues. <q>Faith is of ſuch neceſſity, that they that have it not ſhall loſe the life to which they are elected, or not: if not; then whether the elect believe or no, they ſhall be ſaved: if it be, then there is no abſolute election before faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, 1. The compariſon is between an Act that giveth a right to life (ſuch is juſtification) and an Act which giveth none, ſuch is election: which indeed doth make the donation of right to be a thing future, but is not it ſelfe the Act which giveth it, as we have ſhewed before. Now if a ſinner have a right to the inheritance, and yet it be neceſſary for him to believe that he may inherit, then is his inheriting ſuſpended upon believing; that is, faith is the condition of his inheriting, and ſo the right he had to it before, muſt needs be conditional: more then this, neither reaſon, nor the civil Law requires, to denominate a gift to be conditionall. In election the caſe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: which, becauſe it doth not tranſmit or conveigh any right, but is only a preparation or preordination in the mind of God, of thoſe cauſes by which it ſhall be made to exiſt in time, therefore may the purpoſe it ſelf be abſolute? yea though it be of things which do not exiſt but upon condition. Thus Dr. <note n="d" place="margin">In Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Twiſſe. Neque enim ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus decreta Dei quoad res volitas dici poſſe conditionata: quatenus ſcil. neque vita aeterna niſi ſub conditione fidei conferenda ſit; nec damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, &amp;c.</hi> and particularly of juſtification or pardon of ſin he addes: <hi>Remiſſionem peccatorum &amp; ſalutem omnes conſentiunt nemini contingere niſi ſub conditione fidei. i. e.</hi> All agree, that pardon of ſin and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betides none, but upon condition of faith. God may abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely will or purpoſe to give a right to life upon condition of faith: but he cannot abſolutely give a right to life, and yet afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to believe under a penalty of forfeiting, or loſing that life: for then the gift is not abſolute, but conditional. 2. The word <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> muſt be diſtinguiſhed: for it may be underſtood, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116045:107"/> to God; and ſo whatſoever he purpoſeth is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his purpoſes being immutable, and his power irreſiſtable, it muſt needs be, that whatſoever he purpoſeth muſt come to paſſe: or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to us; and ſo that is neceſſary which is enjoyned us by precept, as a means appointed and ordained of God for ſuch or ſuch an end. The neceſſity of faith in the former ſenſe will by no means inferre that it is a condition; but in the latter ſenſe it will and if God give a right to life, and yet our believing remaine neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as a means appointed for the obtaining of life; then the right we had before was but conditional. The neceſſity of faith compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with election, is only a neceſſity of exiſtence, upon ſuppoſition of a powerful and immutable cauſe. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I my ſelf grant (will it be ſaid) that faith is neceſſary as a means of obtaining life; yet are we elected unto life: ſo that hitherto the caſe is ſtill the ſame. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Therefore we diſtinguiſh farther. Gods giving life may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered either ſimply as it is Gods act, and the execution of his eternal purpoſe; or as withal it is our bleſſedneſſe, &amp; reward. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſpect, faith hath no other order to life, then purely of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent: becauſe he that purpoſed to give life, purpoſed alſo to give faith before it: but it is neither means nor condition nor cauſe of life no more then <hi>Tenderton</hi> ſteeple was the condition or cauſe or means of <hi>Godwin</hi> ſands: or an earthquake over night of the ſuns riſing the next morning. It is in reference to life, only as by the promiſe it is made our reward, that faith hath the nature and order of a means to it. Now, if faith according to the conſtant language of Scripture, be neceſſary as a means to the obtaining of life as a reward; then whatſoever juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication adjudgeth us to life before faith, muſt be conditional. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition of election, both unto faith and unto life, if there were no other act of God which made faith neceſſary to us, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 words">

                        </gap>,</hi> it would be only neceſſary in regard of its preſence or exiſtence, but not at all neceſſary as a means to be uſed by us, in order to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of righteouſneſſe and ſalvation; and ſo election will neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe be abſolute.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the third anſwer which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gives as moſt direct<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> to the Argument, namely that juſtification is abſolute, though faith be neceſſary, becauſe faith is neceſſary only as a conſequent, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength. For, 1. If by conſequent he mean that which is purely and only ſo, ſin and death will put in for as neceſſary an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in juſtification as faith it ſelf. 2. If by conſequence he mean an effect, then is it againe ſuppoſed that faith is an effect of juſtification.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:116045:108"/> which ſhould be proved and not unworthily begged. I read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of beleeving unto righteouſneſſe: of being juſtified unto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I read not a word. 3. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf when he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh juſtification from election, determined the former preciſely to a non-punition. If now it lay claime to faith too, as it's genuine proper effect, his diſtinction evaporates into a nullity. 4. Nor doth he aſcribe any thing more to faith in the matter of juſtification, then all our Divines with one conſent aſcribe to works, namely a neceſſity of preſence, for the neceſſity of faith as a conſequent is no more. Which they indeed aſcribe to works from certaine and plentiful evidence of Scripture: he, to faith, without any evidence at all.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for the defence of the Arguments, which I advanced to prove, that we are not juſtified till we beleeve.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this, in my ſermon I gave a double anſwer. 1. That the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſedneſſe of God need not be extended beyond the perſon of Chriſt, who gave himſelf unto the death, an offering and a ſacrifice unto God of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> in his reply to this, produceth many teſtimonies, of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus, Calvin, Beza, Paraeus, Ward, Ferus;</hi> and ſome reaſons, to prove that which never came into my minde to deny, namely, that God is in Chriſt well pleaſed with ſinners. To all which I ſhall need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no other anſwer, then an explication of that which is given alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The words therefore may be underſtood either, 1. As a teſtimony of God concerning his acceptance of, and well-pleaſedneſſe in Chriſt, as a ſacrifice moſt perfect and ſufficient for obtaining of thoſe ends, and producing thoſe effects for which it was offered, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. And thus is God well pleaſed with Chriſt only, and above all other, men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: or, 2. As they do alſo note the effect as then exiſting, namely, Gods well-pleaſedneſſe with ſinners for Chriſts ſake. Now was it ſuch a prodigious crime in me to ſay, the words may be taken only in the former ſenſe, and ſo confined to the perſon of Chriſt, that I muſt be printed as a man that thinks my ſelf worth a thouſand ſuch as <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Beza, Paraeus,</hi> &amp;c?

And whereas the Text is, <hi>This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> he muſt adde, in whom I am well pleaſed <hi>with ſinners.</hi> 2. And that ſuch an addition as neither the Greeke of the LXX interpreters, nor of the New Teſtament is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, namely that the verbe <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Seeing then the word imports ſuch a delight in, or approbation of a perſon, as ſuppoſeth him endued with lovely and amiable qualities: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man is lovely in Gods eyes without faith (for God delights not in his phyſical ſubſtance, or natural perfections of any ſort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 10.) it follows, that when we are ſaid by faith to pleaſe God, or to be pleaſing to him; or that it is impoſſible to pleaſe him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith: it muſt be underſtood of the pleaſingneſſe of the perſon, as well as of the action. Indeed there is in God a love of benevolence towards the elect, even while they are moſt diſpleaſing to him: but a love of complacency or approbation he hath not towards them till they beleeve. They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor can I imagin how God can be perfectly well-pleaſed with men, and yet perpetually diſpleaſed with every thing they do: which yet he muſt be ſuppoſed to be, if faith do only commend our actions, not our perſons unto God. Amongſt men it is unconceivable, how a total diſpleaſure with another mans actions, can conſiſt with well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſedneſſe with the perſon. That which commends the work doth alſo commend the worker: and if the work be unacceptable, the worker alſo is ſo far unacceptable: if all his works be unacceptable, himſelf alſo is wholly unacceptable. 3. I aske, whether faith it ſelf be pleaſing unto God? principally out of doubt, <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 29. Then when we are ſaid by faith to pleaſe God, it is a great deal too ſlender to interpret it of pleaſing him in obedience onely. 4. And though it be moſt true, that our obedience is not acceptable to God without faith, yet cannot Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> owne it, if he will be true to his doctrine, that ſins are pardoned before the ſinner hath a being; for that obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſeeth no ſin, is acceptable to him. The obedience of the elect is ſuch wherein God ſeeth no ſin (I ſpeak of thoſe works which they may performe before they beleeve: as prayer, hearing of the word, &amp;c.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is acceptable to God. The aſſumption is manifeſt: for not to ſee ſin, and to pardon it, are all one: and God hath from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity pardoned the ſins of the elect: (as ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>)</p>

                     <q>In the following part of this anſwer, he gives us a reaſon why our<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> works without faith cannot pleaſe God: for (ſaith he) <hi>bonum eſt ex cauſá integrá.</hi> Now what is not done in faith, is not done in love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. and conſequently is not fruit unto God.</q>

Whatſoever effect there be in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the elect unregenerate, yet are their works never a whit the more unacceptable for it, upon any other account then becauſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is ſinful; and the ſinfulneſſe being ſuppoſed to be pardoned, and that from eternity, it cannot make the work unacceptable: pardoned ſin, and no ſin, are much of the ſame ſtrength, as to any harme it can do us. 3. If works cannot pleaſe God while there is ſomething wanting which ſhould make them entirely good, how comes it to paſſe that the perſon ſhould be ſo hugely well-pleaſing while there is nothing in him but evil? mens perſons are under Law as well as their actions: <hi>Ars eſt in fabrica rei.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt (ſaith he), <q>That which raiſed a partition-wall between God and the elect, was the breach of the Law: Now when the Law was ſatisfied for their ſins, this partition was broken down; his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour had as free a current, as if they had not ſinned.</q>

If the reaſon of Gods well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſedneſſe with ſinners be this onely, that Chriſt hath removed that which ſeparated between God and them, then the elect are upon the ſame terms with God as <hi>Adam</hi> was (and all mankind in him) before the fall: and Chriſt by his death hath not made a new Covenant, but eſtabliſhed the old. But this is moſt notoriouſly falſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſequence is plaine: for what follows immediately upon the removal of a hindrance, had all its cauſes in being before: as, if my houſe be lightſome immediately upon letting down of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he ſhuts of the windows, it ſuppoſeth the ſun to be up. Now the only means and inſtrument of the communication of life, before the death of Chriſt, was the Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankind in him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if Gods well-pleaſedneſſe follow immediately upon the death of Chriſt, as that which hath removed the hindrance, it follows by virtue of that Covenant, or by none at all. 2. But if the well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of God, do not follow neceſſarily and immediately upon the death of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf will acknowledge his Argument to be null. My anſwer therefore is. That the death of Chriſt did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed immediately undermine and weaken the wall of partition, ſo as that it could not long ſtand: but it did not totally demoliſh and throw it down, preſently; becauſe it was not ſo agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Sonne, in his undertaking for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which becauſe I am purpoſely to prove by and by, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the reader to have a little patience till he come to it. 3. In the mean time, I muſt confeſſe to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> I do not underſtand what he means to tell us of a wall of partition raiſed between God and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. What? are they juſtified, and all their ſins pardoned, and that from eternity, and yet is there a wall of partition between God and them? Is pardoned ſinne able to ſeparate between the ſoul and God? Woe to poore ſinners, if this be true.</p>

Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſets down his words at large: and what ſaith he? why, that God loves the perſons of the elect, but not their vices: as Parents love their childrens perſons, even while they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe them for their vices. But is God therefore <hi>well pleaſed</hi> with the elect, becauſe he loves them, that is, hath purpoſes of doing them good; or becauſe Parents love their children, and would do them all the good they can, are they therefore well pleaſed with them, even while they are correcting them for their vices? let themſelves judge.

For a work to be waſhed and cleanſed in the blood of Chriſt, is to have the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof for his ſake pardoned: which becauſe it is done to the elect, as much in their unregeneracy as after; the good works they do, when regenerate, can be no more acceptable then before.</p>

We were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God by the death of his Sonne.</hi> The anſwer which I gave to it in ſhort was this, That Chriſts death was the price of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſo it is through the death of Chriſt that we are reconciled, be it when it will be that we are reconciled, which that it is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning, we ſhall prove by and by; in the mean time let us ſee what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath againſt it. His exceptions are ſix.</p>
                  <p>1. Saith he, <q>It offers a manifeſt violence to the text, To ſay, <hi>That we were reconciled,</hi> is as much as <hi>we ſhall be reconciled.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> And it is a manifeſt violence to my words, to ſay, that I ſo interpret it. I ſay, we were reconciled <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> immediately in the death of Chriſt, that is, his death purchaſed reconciliation for us: and therefore through that death it is, that we are reconciled actually and <hi>effectivè</hi> whenſoever it be.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond exception is the old irrational notion, <q>That if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation depend upon conditions to be performed by us, then we are the cauſes of our own reconciliation.</q> Where, not only the conſequence is falſe, (as we have largely ſhewed above) but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent alſo impertinent: I am not now diſputing whether recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation follow faith, but whether it exiſt immediately upon the death of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>The third. <q>This reconciliation was made when we were enemies.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> before our believing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet will it not follow, that it was made immediately in the death of Chriſt, which is the thing Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould prove. If we be not reconciled before we are born, it is ſufficient to prove, that we were not reconciled in the death of Chriſt immediately, whether faith be ſuppoſed to be neceſſary or no. 2. The word <hi>reconciled</hi> is uſed twice in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. If they both relate to one and the ſame reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, (of which I doubt, as I ſhall ſhew farther by and by) yet I readily grant that it was made in the death of Chriſt. Were not my
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:116045:116"/> words plain enough before? That we are ſaid to be reconciled unto God in the death of his Sonne, inaſmuch as Chriſts death was the price of our reconciliation. The cauſe was then in being, though the effect do not follow till ſome time after.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, If the meaning were no more but this, <q>That it is through the death of Chriſt that we are reconciled, be it when it will be that we are reconciled, then this clauſe, <hi>when we were enemies,</hi> would be ſuperfluous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>emphaſis</hi> of thoſe words is plain. God reconciles his enemies to himſelf, whenſoever it be that he reconciles them; and Chriſt purchaſed reconciliation for enemies, not for friends. See <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The fifth, <hi>God was in Chriſt, not imputing our ſins to us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That doth not prove, but that I rightly interpret the Apoſtle here. 2. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. reconciling and non-imputing are all one: the latter interprets the former. God did <hi>act towards</hi> the reconciliation of ſinners, and the non-imputation of their ſin in the death of Chriſt, but they were not therefore preſently reconciled, and their ſin non-imputed, as we have ſhewed from the text before. God laid the foundation of a future reconciliation in the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth, <q>That what I grant yields the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reconciliation of ſinners upon the death of Chriſt. For if Chriſt, by the ſhedding of his blood, paid the total and full price for our deliverance from the curſe of the Law, then were we actually ſet free from the obligation of it; for when the debt is paid, the debtour is free in Law.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the conſequent, and the proof of it. Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our Glorification: muſt we therefore needs be glorified as ſoon as he was dead? that is to ſay, many hundreds of years before we are borne. And if he purchaſed one benefit to follow not till many yeares after the price was paid, might he not alſo purchaſe another, and particularly our deliverance from the curſe of the Law, to follow after a like diſtance of time? 2, The reaſon or proof is moſt impertinent. Chriſt cannot purchaſe our deliverance from the curſe, unleſſe the ſaid deliverance follow preſently and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the debt being paid, the debtour is preſently diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged As if I ſhould ſay, the payment of the debt doth preſently diſcharge the debtour. <hi>Ergo,</hi> men cannot purchaſe reverſions. 3. The payment of the debtour doth preſently diſcharge him: but
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:116045:117"/> if it be not the debtour himſelf which makes the payment, but ſome other, he is not diſcharged <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
                  <p>And now, Reader, I ſhall acquaint thee with the Reaſons, why<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> I interpret thoſe words, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. We were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne,</hi> not of our actual and compleat reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, but of that which is purchaſed: and ſo the meaning of the words, <hi>we were reconciled,</hi> will be this; that our reconciliation was then purchaſed, yea, and alſo perfect <hi>ex parte cauſae,</hi> on Chriſts part, ſo that nothing can now hinder our actual, perſonal and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reconciliation with God, but our own refuſing to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: God having conſtituted a moſt ſufficient cauſe of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation in the death of Chriſt. 1. From <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and 9. <hi>While we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us, much more then being juſtified now by his blood. &amp;c.</hi> What in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. is called Juſtification, that in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. is called reconciliation: and <hi>for Chriſt to die for us while we were ſinners, ver.</hi> 8. is all one with what is ſaid, <hi>ver. 10. When we were enemies we were reconciled by his death.</hi> But the time of their Juſtification is expreſſely ſeparated from the time of Chriſts death for them, by the particle <hi>now; While we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> but we are juſtified <hi>now:</hi> which particle <hi>now,</hi> though it have ſeveral ſenſes in Scripture (as we ſhall ſhew by and by,) yet here, being put after the participle <gap reason="foreign">

And the time it notes, is their preſent time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and believing, oppoſed unto that whole time wherein they were yet ſinners. And ſo the whole ſentence runs thus, (moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the Apoſtles ſcope) If while we were yet ſinners (under the power and condemnation of ſin) Chriſt died for us: much more then being juſtified now (that we are believers) by his blood, &amp;c. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, if the particle <hi>now</hi> be borrowed from <hi>ver</hi> 9. and repeated in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. the whole ſenſe of the verſe will be this. <hi>If while we were enemies we were reconciled</hi> (ſc. cauſaliter &amp; quantum ad meritum) <hi>unto God in the death of his Sonne; much more being</hi> now, (viz. ſince we are believers) <hi>reconciled,</hi> (quoad effectum) <hi>we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> and ſo the firſt <hi>reconciled</hi> ſignifies that which is <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> and the ſecond that which is <hi>ex parte noſtri:</hi> the former, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation in the cauſe; the latter, in the effect. Juſt as this ſame
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:116045:117"/> Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth the ſame word, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19, 20. God was in Chriſt reconciling.—Be ye reconciled.</hi> And ſurely faith muſt be ſuppoſed to the <hi>reconciled</hi> in the ſecond part of the verſe, or it is of no uſe at all to ſalvation: for the Apoſtles diſcourſe ſuppoſeth that there is a neceſſary and immediate connexion between reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and ſalvation: ſo that he that is reconciled is immediately capable of being ſaved. <hi>Much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> But no unbeliever is immediately capable of being ſaved, though Chriſt have died for him: for he muſt believe firſt, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf will grant:) If it be ſaid, that faith it ſelfe is part of our ſalvation; the Objector muſt ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelfe and the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as of unbelievers, to this ſenſe: much more being reconciled, we ſhall have faith given us, which is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe.</p>
                  <p>2. And that our being reconciled in the death of Chriſt, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> in reference to the ſufficiency of what Chriſt hath done, in order to our reconciliation, appears farther from the compariſon of contraries, by which the Apoſtle illuſtrates this whole doctrine, from <hi>v.</hi> 12. to the end of the chapter. Look then, as by vertue of <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience death paſſed upon all mankinde, as ſoon as they are the children of <hi>Adam:</hi> ſo by the obedience of Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation obtained, by which all that are borne of Chriſt by faith are reconciled unto God. Now if a man ſhould ſay, <hi>All men are dead in Adam,</hi> as in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. though he ſpeak of the effect as wrought, yet he muſt be underſtood as intending no more, then that the cauſe of all mens death was in being, as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (for ſurely men cannot be dead before they are borne, or have a being) ſo when it is ſaid, men are reconciled in the death of Chriſt, the word <hi>reconciled</hi> muſt be underſtood in like manner, as noting the vertue of the cauſe, not the effect as already produced. I know Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> thinks, that all men were actually <hi>&amp; quoad effectum,</hi> condemned in <hi>Adam.</hi> But I would he would make this probable, yea, or conceivable; for I confeſſe my dull head cannot apprehend it: though I do eaſily conceive how we may be ſaid to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him cauſally (for the common ſin of our nature) namely, that the cauſes of our condemnation were then in being, which do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce the effect of condemnation upon us, as ſoon as we exiſt. But condemnation is a real tranſient act. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ſuppoſeth its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject really exiſting: but it is unconceivable how men ſhould really exiſt, five or ſix thouſand yeares before they are borne. Seeing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:116045:118"/> then our reconciliation in the death of Chriſt, by the Apoſtles own Explication, is of the ſame kinde with our condemnation in <hi>Adam:</hi> it is manifeſt it muſt be underſtood of reconciliation in the cauſe, not in the effect.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it trouble the Reader, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks as if the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> were wrought (we were <hi>reconciled</hi>) for nothing more common in Scripture, then to ſpeak of the effect as wrought, when proviſion is made of a ſufficient cauſe, by which it ſhall or may be wrought, <hi>Ezek. 24. 13. I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged,</hi> that is, there was nothing wanting on Gods part that might conduce to her purging, though the effect did not follow, <hi>Col. 1. 23. the Goſpel was preached to every creature under heaven:</hi> not that every perſon and Nation had then heard the Goſpel (for they have not yet heard it) but that by Gods permiſſion and commandment they might hear it. Chriſt hath <hi>aboliſhed</hi> death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. namely, he is the authour and cauſe of its abolition, or he hath aboliſhed it <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> for death is not deſtroyed <hi>de facto &amp; quoad effectum,</hi> till the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26, 54. ſo in verbs of active ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, <hi>Heb. 4. 12. The Word of God is powerful,—piercing to the dividing aſunder, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 19. 7, 8. <hi>converting, making wiſe, rejoycing the heart, enlightening the eyes,</hi> all which do not ſo much ſignifie the act, as the vertue and ſufficiency of the cauſe. In like manner, when Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 John 2. 2. it is to be underſtood of the vertue and ſufficiency of his blood to take away ſin, not of a propitiation then preſently wrought and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: for there is none ſuch before faith, if the Apoſtle may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> Multitudes of like inſtances are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
                  <p>A third Argument is that mentioned in my Sermon out of <hi>v.</hi> 11.<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>By whom we have now alſo received the atonement,</hi> which in plainer termes is this, <hi>That now,</hi> that is, ſince we are believers, <hi>we are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> reconciled unto God.</p>

                  <p>His ſecond anſwer therefore is, <q>We cannot receive or apply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to our ſelves but by faith, yet it follows not, that God did not account it to us before.</q>

                  <p>FOr farther Explication of the difference between our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> in the death of Chriſt, and after our believing, I obſerved (out of <hi>Grotius</hi>) a diſtinction of three periods of the Will of God. 1. As it may be conceived immediately after ſin committed, before the conſideration of the death of Chriſt. And now is the Lord at enmity with the ſinner: though not averſe from all ways and meanes, by which he may returne to friendſhip with him again. 2. As it may be conceived after the death of Chriſt, and now is the Lord, not only appeaſable, but doth alſo promiſe, that he will be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſinners, upon ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:116045:119"/> the ſame Will of God may be conſidered after an interceſſion on Chriſts part, and faith on the ſinners part: and now is God actually reconciled, and in friendſhip with the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Againſt any of theſe particulars Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> excepts nothing, but exclaims againſt the whole as <hi>extreamly groſſe;</hi> and why? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe it makes God changeable. But as groſſe as it is, not our Proteſtants only, but the Scriptures alſo own every ſyllable of it, nor will the ſatisfaction of Chriſt ſtand without it. God was in friendſhip with <hi>Adam,</hi> while he continued righteous and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin. I conceive it is next to an impoſſibility, that the righteous Lord ſhould be at enmity with a righteous man, who neither is a ſinner, nor in the room of a ſinner. After <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, was not God at enmity with him? Yes ſurely, unleſſe Chriſt be dead in vaine: by his death we were reconciled while we were enemies. After the death of Chriſt, God is reconciled unto ſinners. Lo here, God is a friend, an enemy, and reconciled again: and is this ſuch monſtrous Divinity with Mr. <hi>Eyre?</hi> But for the Readers farther information, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, how God may be firſt a friend, then an enemy, then reconciled, without any variableneſſe or ſhadow of changing in himſelfe; and then ſhall adde a word or two more concerning our reconciliation in the death of Chriſt, and ſo return to Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>

                  <p>And this (for example) is the friendſhip between (<note n="h" place="margin">Ariſtot. ibid c. 8, 11.</note>) a Prince and<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> his ſubjects, conſiſting on his part, in his providing for their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and welfare, by and according to Law: and on their part in their ſubjection and obedience to him, according to the ſame Law: As on the contrary, the enmity between them conſiſts, on their part, in their breaking of the Laws, eſtabliſhed and maintained by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:

Thus ſtood the caſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally between God and man; God being engaged by his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reward obedient man with life, and to puniſh him if he ſhould be diſobedient in the leaſt; the former of which was his friendſhip; and the latter (when the Law was broken) his enmity, <hi>Rom. 5. v.</hi> 10. 13. 15, 16, 17. compared.

Should he be an enemy to man perfectly righteous, or not an enemy to him while a ſinner, or not reconciled to him when penitent, and a believer, he muſt deny himſelf; ſo little cauſe hath Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to charge us with Vorſtian Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Then for the ſecond thing, I wiſh Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had told us more<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> plainly what he would have, when he contends for the reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the elect, immediately in the death of Chriſt. Doth he mean
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:116045:120"/> that they were then <hi>perfectly</hi> reconciled? This I am ſo farre from believing, that though I thankfully acknowledge that Chriſt merited a perfect reconciliation (as he did alſo a perfect ſanctification) yet I cannot beleeve, that the elect are perfectly reconciled during this life, no, nor till the Reſurrection: For 1. If the elect be already perfectly reconciled, then Chriſt is no longer a Mediatour between God and them. But Chriſt is moſt certainly a Mediatour between God and them: not an <hi>arbiter</hi> only, or <hi>internunti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon of the Propoſition is, becauſe it is the very nature and work of a Mediatour to (<note n="k" place="margin">Vide Hug. Grot. de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfact p. 172. ex Suidâ.</note>) make peace: and common ſenſe informes us, that there is no need of a Mediatour where there is no diſagreement; and the Scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, <hi>Gal. 3 20. A Mediatour is not of one,</hi> that is, of them that are at perfect friendſhip and agreement one with another. And therefore when all enmity between God and man ſhall be deſtroyed perfectly, Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to be any longer a Mediatour. For <hi>he muſt reigne till all enemies be put under his fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To ſay, he a Mediatour ſtill, not to perfect, but to manifeſt reconciliation, is to ſay nothing: For the want of the manifeſtation of reconciliation is ſome part of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or not. If it be, then God and believers are not yet perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: if not; then ſhall not Chriſt need to be a Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them for that end. 2. If it be the work of Chriſt in heaven to make reconciliation for ſinners on earth, then thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not perfectly reconciled to God at preſent. But the firſt is true. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The text is plain, <hi>Heb. 2. 17. It behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt, in things pertaining unto God, to make reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the ſins of the people.</hi> The Apoſtles ſcope is to ſhew the neceſſity of Chriſts ſufferings on earth before he went to heaven, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. namely, that from the experience of his own ſufferings and temptations here, he might be the more merciful and faithful to make reconciliation for our ſins. Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. Nor can this be meant of making known or manifeſting reconciliation. For 1. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, notes ſuch an act as is converſant. firſt about God: <hi>that he might be faithful in things pertaining to God,</hi> ſayes the text: even as the object of the ſervice of every High Prieſt ordained for men, is <hi>things pertaining to God,</hi> primarily and in the firſt place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. But to manifeſt reconciliation, is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:116045:120"/> an act primarily and totally converſant about us, not an act to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for us. 2. The manifeſtation of reconciliation being wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt, is moſt properly an act of Chriſt, as King: but the reconciliation here ſpoken of, is preciſely and formally the act of Chriſt as Prieſt. 3. And as the Greek word is not ſo much as pretended to ſignifie a manifeſtation in any other place, ſo in this eſpecially it cannot have that ſenſe, becauſe the conſtruction will not bear it. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to reconcile ſins, is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to make a reconciliation or propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with God for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>But if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> mean no more, then that the death of Chriſt did immediately effect an imperfect and initial reconciliation, he knows that I yield it in part, <hi>viz.</hi> that God through the death of Chriſt, hath ſo far forth laid aſide his enmity againſt ſinners, as that he is ready to receive them into his favour if they will beleeve and repent: whereof alſo he hath given them ſuch aſſurance in his Goſpel: that if now they be not reconciled, it is becauſe they wil not be reconciled: if they die, it is becauſe they will die. But if his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that this reconciliation is begun to be applied immediately upon the death of Chriſt; then 1. Let him no longer urge the bare word: but ſeeing reconciliation hath its degrees, let him demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that it muſt-be underſtood, not of the firſt degree (which I ſtand for,) but of the ſecond, which begins in application. 2. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire alſo to know, by what act God doth apply this reconciliation to men that have no being till many ages after Chriſts death? Is it by ſome act of his minde? ſurely that will be very dangerous to affirme, that any immanent act of God hath its beginning after the death of Chriſt. Is it a tranſient act? ſhew us then its object: it is paſt imagination, how an effect can be wrought and exiſt in or upon an object, which it ſelfe hath no exiſtence.

                  <p>I Had ſaid in my Sermon, that it is through the death of Chriſt that<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> the promiſe of reconciliation is made, by and according to which we are actually reconciled to God after we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>This, after Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath repreſented and paraphraſed as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and charged it (of courſe) with the imputations of Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme and Popery, at laſt he advanceth foure Arguments againſt it, as he ſaith: but if the Reader will peruſe them, he will find there is not one: I ſay againe, not one: but all of them levelled againſt a poſition, which never came into my mind to owne. <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt purchaſed only a conditional promiſe. <hi>Si ſat ſit accuſaſſe, quis erit innocens?</hi> I ſay therefore that Chriſt did indeed purchaſe the conditional Covenant: but I ſay withal, that if we look to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Chriſt in purchaſing, he purchaſed the infallible application or donation of every bleſſing of the Covenant unto ſome, namely the elect. If this be Arminianiſme, I am an Arminian: yea and ſo ſtrong in the perſuaſion, that I cannot hope of my ſelf, that I ſhall be altered by any mans writings which I have ſeen, or am like to ſee while I live. But what? cannot a general pardon be purchaſed for all, becauſe it is intended that ſome ſhall infallibly be pardoned and ſaved by it? or is not ſuch a pardon the firſt Act and degree of our
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:116045:121"/> reconciliation, becauſe other things are purchaſed as well as it? more then this I ſhall not need to ſay to any of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Arguments: nor do I intend to ſay more to the three laſt: the firſt, becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſome Scriptures for an immediate reconciliation in the death of Chriſt, I ſhall anſwer to particularly.</p>
                  <p>The Argument then is this. <q>The Scripture no where ſaies, that Chriſt died to obtaine a conditional grant, but to make an end of ſin, <hi>Dan. 9. 24.

Doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> think this conſequence needs no proofe?

To <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 20. It pleaſed the Father, having made peace through the blood of his croſſe, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf, &amp;c. The anſwer is ready. That the making of peace in the death of Chriſt, is here mentioned as the means to that reconciliation of all things to himſelf, which the Father intended thereby; for both the making of peace and reconciliation are here mentioned as the acts of God, as the firſt and principal cauſe: and the latter, the effect and end of the former. God hath made peace in Chriſts death, that he might reconcile us to himſelf. I appeal to any man that knows what a conſequence is, whether it will hence follow, that ſinners were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled immediately in the death of Chriſt, without the intervention of a Covenant, that is, without the miniſtry of reconciliation. Yea rather the juſt contrary follows: for making of peace in Chriſts death, is here made the means and cauſe of a future reconciliation that follows, when? even when by the Goſpel ſinners are converted
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:116045:122"/> unto God. As is evident in the example of theſe <hi>Coloſſians, v.</hi> 21.

Can any thing be ſpoken more fully againſt the immediate reconciliation of ſinners in the death of Chriſt? or for proofe, that Chriſt obtained that Covenant of peace, through the preaching of which the Gentiles were converted, and ſo reconciled unto God? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. ſaith that Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law: that is, paid the price of our redemption, or obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternal redemption for us, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. but doth it ſay that we are delivered without a Covenant made in the ſame blood and death of Chriſt? nay the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth the juſt contrary, namely that bleſſedneſſe (whereof ſure our reconciliation with God is no ſmall part) is given to us by Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 14, 15, 16. Even that which he calls the promiſe by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 22. The laſt text is that mentioned in my ſermon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. Chriſt (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) doth not ſay that he ſhed his blood to procure a condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al promiſe, but for the remiſſion of the ſins of many. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But he ſayes, his blood was the blood of the New-Teſtament, which was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins.

                  <p>1. Saith he, Chriſt was held in the ſame obligation which we were under: he was made under the ſame Law, <hi>Gal. 4. 3, 4. Anſ.</hi> Why? Is a ſurety held in the ſame obligation, becauſe he is bound to pay the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:116045:123"/> ſame ſumme? then is there no difference between the ſurety and the principal debtour. The Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 3, 4. ſaith that Chriſt was made of a woman, made under the Law. As the former expreſſion implies; that though he were of a woman <hi>quoad corpulentam ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> yet he came not from her <hi>quoad rationem ſeminalem,</hi> according to the common rule of nature, by which children are wont to be borne into the world: ſo doth the latter imply, that though his obedience for ſubſtance, were the ſame which the Law required of us; yet was it not performed by virtue of that common obligation which lyes upon us, but by ſpecial oeconomy and appointment. <note n="x" place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſame anſwer I give to the ſecond text. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Chriſt was made a curſe for us, and dyed for us, <hi>Heb. 2. 9, 14. Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> 53. 4, 5. for none of theſe things prove that he was any of thoſe, who by the Law were obliged to die: yea it is certaine he was not: for the Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth none to death but ſinners: yea and for the very matter of the curſe and death which Chriſt ſuffered, (though that do not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerne our queſtion: for though he had ſuffered the <hi>idem</hi> in regard of the matter of his puniſhment; yet formally, as his death was a ſatisfaction or payment, that <hi>idem</hi> was no more then the <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundem</hi> which I plead for) yet I ſay it is certaine that there is ſome kind of evil in the curſe executed upon ſinners, which was never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon Chriſt, as an excluſion from all intereſt in Gods favour; the defacing of his image in his ſoul, rage and deſpaire of conſcience, and the like. The anſwer therefore is, Chriſt was indeed made a curſe for us, not that the Law did curſe him, or had power ſo to do: but becauſe by ſpecial compact between his father and himſelf he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured that puniſhment (for the maine) which the Law threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 7. A body haſt thou prepared me—Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> come to do thy will, even as it was by a ſpecial Law, that beaſts were ſlaine and ſacrificed unto God of old: and not by that general Law, which curſeth every one that ſinneth. Hence it follows thirdly, that when our ſins are ſaid <hi>to be laid upon Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. 53. 6. (Which is Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> third Argument) it doth by no means follow that the death of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:116045:124"/> Chriſt was that which the Law required, but that Chriſt was made to beare that puniſhment, which in weight and value was the ſame which we ſhould elſe have borne, though it be not arithmetically the ſame. If any man can make more of thoſe words, let him. His fourth and laſt Argument is this. <hi>If God would have diſpenſed with the</hi> idem <hi>in the firſt obligation, Chriſt need not have died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a very ſtrange conſequence: for God did therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with the <hi>idem,</hi> that there might be way made for the death of Chriſt. That which was in the obligation was <hi>our puniſhment:</hi> if God did not diſpenſe with this, it had been impoſſible for Chriſt to have died for us, but the Law muſt be executed upon every ſinner in his own perſon. But behold the proofe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>If the juſtice of God would be ſatisfied with leſſe then the penalty of the Law, he might as well have diſpenſed with the whole.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Hitherto then the matter is ſafe. That the death of Chriſt was not<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> the payment of the ſame which was in the obligation. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it doth not deliver <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> for explication of which I added: that if the debtour himſelf do bring unto the creditour that which he ows him, it preſently diſchargeth him: but the payment of a ſurety doth not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why not (ſaith Mr.</hi> Eyre) <hi>Amongſt men there is no difference: ſo the debt be paid, it matters not whether it be by the principal, or his ſurety: the obligation is void in reſpect of both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which if they be both in the very ſame bond and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath ſome thing of truth in it: (though then alſo the ſurety hath the ſame action againſt the debtour, which the creditor had before) otherwiſe it is moſt notoriouſly falſe, and the contrary determined frequently in the <note n="y" place="margin">I. in ſumma l.

If the payment of the ſurety do preſently diſcharge the debtour, it is becauſe he agrees with the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that the payment which he makes ſhall be accepted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and immediate diſcharge of the debtour, which is the ſecond thing I beganne to mention before, and ſhall now farther explaine. The death of Chriſt being not the very ſame which was in the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore that it may be effectual for our deliverance, there is a double act required on Gods part, to whom this payment is made: the one is, to admit or give way that ſatisfaction be made; the other
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:116045:124"/> 
                     <hi>factam ratam habere</hi> to accept it when made, and conſequently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and free the debtour: for Chriſts ſatisfaction was admitted, that our obligation might he deſtroyed by the intervening act of God, the ſupream Governour of mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation—that he may be the juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Chriſt being not a ſinner, but a ſurety, and his payment not the payment of the principal debtour, but of a ſurety; therefore it is in his power to agree, whether his payment ſhall be accepted and be effectual for the diſcharge of the ſinner preſently, or for ſome time to come: abſolutely, or upon condition. Whence (by the way) appears what little ſtrength there is in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſecond exception, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſts payment is leſſe efficacious, then if we had paid our ſelves, if we be not thereby diſcharged preſently, becauſe Chriſts ſatisfaction produceth its effects according to the agreement between his Father and himſelf, and no otherwiſe: and the virtue of it is to be meaſured by the greatneſſe of the effect, which could not be wrought by any meer created cauſe: whether it produce it ſooner or later, upon condition or without.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if we prove that the Father and Son agreed, that none<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> ſhould have actual diſcharge by the death of Chriſt till they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; we carry the cauſe, by Mr, <hi>Eyres</hi> owne judgement. Yet in yielding thus much he hath not a little prejudiced the authority of his own determinations. (ſo I call them, becauſe he lays them downe ſo peremptorily and axiomatically as if they needed no proofe). How often doth he tell us before and after this conceſſion, that our diſcharge in the death of Chriſt, <hi>muſt needs</hi> be preſent and immediate? as <hi>pag.</hi> 68. §. 7. Our diſcharge from the Law was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not to be <hi>ſub termino</hi> or <hi>in diem,</hi> but preſent and immediate. And in this chapter, §. 13. The death of Chriſt, as it is a ſatisfaction or payment, ſo the diſcharge thereby procured <hi>muſt needs</hi> be preſent and immediate. As if it were a contradiction in the nature of the thing, that we ſhould not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcharged, if Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction. And yet here yeelds that by a contract or agreement between the Father and the Sonne, the diſcharge obtained in Chriſts ſatisfaction may be ſuſpended. It is therefore a thing poſſible that Chriſt may have ſatisfied, and yet we (the elect I mean) not be preſently diſcharged. And what then means the <hi>muſt needs?</hi> were it a thing denyed, it were eaſie to give innumerable inſtances of ſatisfaction made, when yet the perſon for whom it is made, is not preſently freed: but becauſe it is not denied,

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Where doth the Apoſtle ſay theſe words? If M. <hi>Eyre</hi> give us onely the ſenſe of them; we ſhall ſhew preſently, that what I ſay is included as part of the ſenſe. But I will never beleeve while I live,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:116045:127"/> that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath rightly expreſſed the Apoſtles ſenſe. As if the Apoſtle ſpake againſt joyning of any thing with Chriſt as neceſſary to attaine ſalvation (unleſſe by joyning <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> he mean in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual degree of cauſality, or as ſharing in that kind of cauſality which Chriſt put forth for our ſalvation). For out of doubt, Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are neceſſary to be joyned with Chriſt, that we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 2. But to diſcover how palpably Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath abuſed me in charging me with an abuſe of the Text, let us tranſcribe the words. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If you be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing. For I teſtifie againe to every man that is circumciſed, that he is a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the whole Law. Chriſt is become of no effect to you: whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, you are fallen from grace. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by faith. For in Jeſus Chriſt, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion; but faith which worketh by Love. 1. I do here obſerve the Apoſtles Argument by which he proves, that if they be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing. Thus it runs. He that is bound to keep the whole Law for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to him is Chriſt of no effect for juſtification. He that is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed is bound to keep the whole Law for juſtification. <hi>v. 3. Ergo,</hi> Chriſt is of no effect to him: or as the Apoſtle varies the words, <hi>v. 4. Ergo,</hi> he is fallen from grace, whoſoever he be that expects to be juſtified by the Law. In oppoſition to this he declares in his own, and other Chriſtians example the only way how Chriſt may become profitable, and of effect to us for juſtification, and that is by faith, without legal performances, <hi>v.</hi> 5. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſſe by faith. And have I yet abuſed the Text, becauſe I ſay it hath this ſenſe, that without faith Chriſt ſhall profit us nothing? yea. 2. The whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle proceeds upon this ground, that legal obſervances make Chriſt of none effect to us, becauſe they overthrow faith. For he that will be juſtified by the Law, muſt keep the whole Law; and that deſtroys faith: as he had alſo often and plainly told them before, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 12. 10, 11, 17, 18. compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 14. 3. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth in the very next words that the Apoſtle attributes that to faith which he denyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o other works, <hi>v.</hi> 6. In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion, but faith which worketh by love. I aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> But the thing denied to other works, is, that they are able to juſtifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yea rather that they make it impoſſible for us to be juſtified, becauſe they make Chriſt to become of none effect to us, <hi>v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, 4. Ergo,</hi> the thing aſcribed to faith is, that by it we are juſtified, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:116045:127"/> through it doth Chriſt become profitable, and grace of effect to our Juſtification. <hi>Ergo,</hi> without it Chriſt profits us nothing, as to that end and purpoſe. Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> contradicts himſelf immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, in his Comment upon that, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <q>When he ſayes, that the intent of the Apoſtle here, was not to ſhew what it is that doth juſtifie, but what are the exerciſes of divine worſhip in which Chriſtians ſhould be converſant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But out of doubt his meaning was to ſhew, how Chriſt and grace become effectual to our Juſtification, if he do here aſcribe to faith that which before he had denied to other works: which is Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> own grant, and the Apoſtles unqueſtionable intent: for the words (as appears by the particle <hi>for,</hi> in the beginning of the verſe) are the reaſon why through faith he expected Juſtification, and not in the way of circumciſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. to wit, becauſe circumciſion avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, no, nor uncircumciſion neither, but faith which worketh by love, which reaſon of his faith he had alſo given before, <hi>chapt.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe two truly godly learned Authours, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> alledgeth as abetting what he ſaith, concerning the Apoſtles intent, if the cauſe were to be carried by number of voices, we could quickly diſpatch it. But neither do either of theſe gratifie Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> a whit. <hi>Calvins</hi> words are theſe, <hi>Quantum ad praeſentem locum attinet, Paulus nequaquam diſputat an charitas ad juſtificandum cooperetur fidei, ſed tantùm indicat quae nunc ſint vera fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium exercitia. i. e.</hi> As to the preſent place, <hi>Paul</hi> doth by no meanes diſpute, whether love do cooperate with faith unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only intimates what are now the true exerciſes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Is this all one, as if he had ſaid, faith availes us nothing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Juſtification before God? the contrary to which he had ſpoke but juſt before, upon <hi>v.</hi> 5. Obj. <hi>Nulláne igitur utilitas erit circumciſionis? Reſpondet, in Chriſto nihil valere: ideoque juſtitiam in fide ſitam eſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Perkins</hi> his words are theſe, in anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Papiſts from thoſe words, <hi>Faith worketh by love. Paul</hi> (ſaith he) doth not ſhew in this verſe what juſtifieth, but what are the exerciſes of godlineſſe in which Chriſtians muſt be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied. And he doth not ſhew how faith juſtifieth, but how it may be diſcerned to be true faith, namely, by love. But neither doth this intend any thing more, then to ſhew the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith as working by love, <hi>viz.</hi> not that it juſtifieth as working by love, though it be the property of that faith by which we are juſtified, to work by love. But he was far from thinking, that faith was no whit available to our Juſtification before God. It is hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>s
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:116045:128"/> own obſervation upon this very verſe, not far before. <hi>The ſecond Concluſion, Faith is of great uſe and acceptation in the Kingdome of Chriſt. By it, firſt our perſons, and then our actions pleaſe God: and without it nothing pleaſeth God.</hi> And immediately after theſe words which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> refers to, diſputes for Juſtification by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, againſt the Papiſts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This upon the matter is to deny that the teſtimony is true. 1. Life doth here ſignifie all that bleſſedneſſe which God hath given us in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver. 11. Ergo,</hi> he that hath not the Son, hath no benefit by him. But he that believeth not, hath not the Sonne; for to have the Sonne is to believe on him. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he that believeth not, hath not the Sonne, nor any benefit by him. That we have the Sonne by believing on him is manifeſt: 1. From the Apoſtles own interpretation; for having ſpoke in general, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life,</hi> he applies it particularly to thoſe to whom he writes, <hi>v. 13. And theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the Name of the Sonne of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</hi> 2. From the perpetual ſenſe of the phraſe, throughout all theſe Epiſtles, as <hi>chap. 2. 23. Whoſoever denieth the Sonne, the ſame hath not the Father: but he that acknowledgeth the Sonne, hath the Father alſo;</hi> ſuitable to what this <hi>John</hi> records in his Goſpel. <hi>chap. 12. 44, 45. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that ſent me: And he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me.</hi> And more expreſſely in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, 2 <hi>ep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 9. Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, HATH NOT GOD: But he that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, HE HATH both the Father and the Sonne.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>ep.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>2. If we are ſaid in Scripture, any where <hi>to have the Son,</hi> in any other ſenſe then by believing, or as excluding believing, why have we no intelligence of it? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> might very well think we ſhould interpret his ſilence (partly, in that he declares not how we may be ſaid <hi>to have Chriſt</hi> any otherwiſe then by faith; partly, in not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to juſtifie it from the phraſe of Scripture) as an argument that himſelf is conſcious, that the doctrine which he here ſuggeſts
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:116045:128"/> hath no footing in the Scriptures. Briefly, the Apoſtle ſpeaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction or limitation, <hi>He that hath the Sonne, hath life:</hi> even that eternal life whereof he ſpake in the verſe immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If the Son may be had without believing, then eternal life may be had without believing alſo; wherefore we winde up the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it were the Will of God that none ſhould have the life which is in his Sonne, till by believing he had the Sonne; then was it his Will that none ſhould be juſtified by the death of Chriſt till they did beleeve. The reaſon is: becauſe the life of pardon or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is an eminent part of that life which God hath given us in his Sonne, and virtually includes all that life we have by Chriſt. But the antecedent is proved true from the text. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the conſequent is true.</p>
                  <p>To theſe texts mentioned in my Sermon, and now vindicated, let<note place="margin">§. 41.</note> me adde one or two more. If God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; then was it not the Will of God, that any man ſhould have actual remiſſion or Juſtification by the blood of Chriſt, till he did beleeve. But God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his blood. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Aſſumption is the Apoſtles own words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. The reaſon of the Propoſition is plain, becauſe if any man be pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied immediately in the death of Chriſt, then is not Chriſt a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <note n="z" place="margin">Inſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that otherwhile faith ſignifies Chriſt believed on: we have often (and I truſt ſatisfactorily) diſcovered, that they are inventions from beneath, not doctrines from above.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> brings to prove, that it was the<note place="margin">§. 42.</note> Will of God and Chriſt, that his death ſhould be available to the immediate and actual reconciliation of ſinners, without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on performed on their part.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the Queſtion is, Whether it were the Will of God, that remiſſion ſhould follow immediately upon the offering up of this ſacrifice, before the ſinner beleeves and repents?</p>
                  <p>2. <q>That this ranſome was alone, and by it ſelfe, a full, adequate, and perfect ſatisfaction to divine Juſtice for all their ſins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the Queſtion is, whether ſatisfaction may not be made by a voluntary ſurety, with this agreement, that they for whom it is made, ſhall not be freed by it, till they performe ſuch or ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? If it may, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> granted but now) then he ſhould have told us, not only that Chriſt made ſatisfaction, but that he made it with this intent, that the elect ſhould be preſently diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. Otherwiſe he begs the Queſtion a ſecond time.</p>
                  <p>3. <q>God accepted it, and declared himſelf well-pleaſed therewith: inſomuch that he hath thereupon covenanted and ſworne, that he will never remember their ſins, nor be wroth with them any more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 25. and 54. 9, 10.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Queſtion is ſtill begg'd. No doubt but God was well-pleaſed with the death of Chriſt, as with a ſacrifice or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it ſelf ſo perfect, that his juſtice could not require more.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:116045:129"/> But whether he accepted it and was well-pleaſed with it, ſo as that it ſhould preſently, without the intervention of faith, produce the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of any, is the queſtion: which is here reſolved by a go-by. It is certain, that ſome effects of Chriſts ſatisfaction are not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the elect, before they believe, much leſſe immediately in the death of Chriſt: and ſeeing we are to grow up in him in all things, till we have attained to the fulneſſe of the life of Chriſt; I confeſſe it is beyond my comprehenſion, how we come to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one part of his life, that is, in one fruit and effect of his death, while we remain imperfect in all the reſt. As to the Covenant which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſpeaks of, that God will never remember the ſins of the elect, nor be wroth with them any more, <hi>Iſa. 43. 25. and</hi> 54. 9, 10. The former place proves no more, then that God takes it as one of his royal prerogatives, to be a God that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſin (as he alſo doth elſewhere, <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. Mich.</hi> 7. 18.) the latter, that the pardon which he gives is eternal: neither, that the elect are pardoned immediately in the death of Chriſt, or while they continue in unbelief. But the contrary is plainly ſuppoſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>4. <q>That by this ranſome of Chriſt they are freed and delivered from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. and 3. 13.</q>

                  <p>The third Argument is this: <q>If it were the Will of God that the death of Chriſt ſhould be the payment of our debt, and a full<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> ſatisfaction for all our iniquities; then was it his Will that our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge procured thereby, ſhould be immediate.

                     </hi> had yielded it a thing poſſible for ſuch an agreement to have paſſed between the Father and the Sonne, as that the Sons ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſhould not preſently and immediately effect the diſcharge of thoſe for whom he ſatisfied. But this argument ſuppoſeth, that the death of Chriſt was neither payment nor ſatisfaction, if ſuch a Covenant paſſed between them. If it be poſſible that there might
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:116045:131"/> be ſuch an Agreement paſſe between the Father and the Sonne, (as it is moſt certain it did) then muſt this Argument needs be inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, which infers the actual and immediate freedome of the elect in the death of Chriſt, becauſe his death was a ſatisfaction. We ſhall therefore prove by and by, that ſatisfaction doth not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer the diſcharge of the debtour. In the mean time, I except, 1. Againſt the confuſed uſe of thoſe two termes, <hi>payment</hi> and <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which in this Argument ought to be diſtinguiſhed; the former noting ſuch a payment as is of the thing it ſelf in the obligation, the latter a payment refuſable. 2. That the will of God is here made the cauſe of Chriſts death, being a ſatisfaction: in which (though I beleeve Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> means no ill) there may be a very great miſtake: for it ſeems to imply that it was not ſo much the value and worth of Chriſts offering which made it a ſatisfaction, as the will of God who would accept it as ſatisfactory. 3. But to the Argument it ſelf; That Chriſt paid our debt, is an ambiguous expreſſion: either it ſignifies, 1. That he was puniſhed for our ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo paid that ſumme which otherwiſe ſhould have been required of us, (and in this ſenſe it is moſt true) or, 2. That he tranſlated our very obligation upon himſelf, and ſo paid as in our names, and as repreſenting us in making pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and thus I deny it, as dangerouſly falſe. The reaſon is ready: becauſe what is done, as in our name and perſon, is not ſo much his Act that doth it as ours, whom he repreſents in doing it: whether he repreſent us by our will and conſent (as Proctors and Atturnies that pay and receive monies, or tranſact buſineſſe in our name, and Ambaſſadours whom Princes ſend into forraigne Nations) or by the authority of Law (as what Tutors do in the name of their Pupills and Minors:) in all which, whatſoever is done as in the perſon of another, is not ſo properly his Act that doth it, as theirs whoſe perſon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents. And if Chriſt thus paid our debt, then his payment was more properly our Act then his own; we our ſelves have ſatisfied, merited and redeemed our ſelves: which a Chriſtians eares can never endure. Now to apply the diſtinction. When Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, that Chriſts death was the payment of our debts, if he mean it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe, of what is <hi>

And the phraſes of Scripture, which declare that Chriſt dyed <hi>for us, and for our ſins,</hi> do indeed well prove the former, that Chriſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:116045:131"/> was ſubſtituted in our roome to make ſatisfaction to the Law for our ſins; but they do by no means prove that he paid our debt in the latter ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſtanding in the ſame obligation with us, and repreſenting our perſons in the payment which he made: no more, then thoſe words, <note n="a" place="margin">

That Chriſt had ſuch an intent, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proves, becauſe his death was a payment or ſatisfaction. The queſtion then between him and me now is, whether an agreement between a credit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r and a ſurety, that the debtor ſhall not be diſcharged immediately upon the ſureties payment, be poſſible, or conſiſtent with the nature of that payment and ſatisfaction which a ſurety makes? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is for the negative (and the Reader hath his word for it, and nothing elſe, inſtead of Argument). I am for the affirmative, upon the following grounds. <hi>Peter</hi> owes <hi>James</hi> a 100. l. whereof he is not able to pay him one farthing. <hi>John</hi> out of love and compaſſion to <hi>Peter,</hi> and without his knowledge, interpoſeth as a ſurety. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gageth to <hi>James,</hi> that if he will accept of payment from him, he will pay him the ſaid 100. l.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:116045:132"/> provided and agreed between them both, that <hi>Peters</hi> bond ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in full force, and ſo himſelf not be diſcharged till a month after; upon theſe terms <hi>John</hi> payes his mony, and <hi>James</hi> receives it. Here the ſumme is paid, and yet the debtor remains for a time obliged. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not diſcharged immediately upon the ſureties payment. Nor is there any thing in this agreement inconſiſtent with the nature of payment or ſatisfaction. 1. <hi>John</hi> the ſurety might have choſen whether he would have paid or engage to pay the ſaid 100. l. 2. <hi>James</hi> the creditor alſo might have choſen whether he would have admitted <hi>John</hi> to be paymaſter or no. 3. Foraſmuch therefore as there is no Law to compel the one to pay, or the other to receive, but it is meerly the voluntary act of both which mutually engageth them; it followes neceſſarily, that it is in the power of them both to agree upon the tearms and time when <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall be diſcharged by virtue of this payment: becauſe it is in our power to put what Laws we pleaſe upon actions which depend meerly on our own will: otherwiſe a man might be free and not free at the ſame time, and in reference to the ſame action, which is a contradiction. Therefore payment is made (for the creditor is poſſeſſed of as much as the debtor ought him) yet the debtor is not preſently diſcharged. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the payment of a debt (or rather ſatisfaction for a debt) doth not in all caſes preſently diſcharge the debtor. Other caſes the Reader may ſee in the civil Law: which I deſire him to looke in the places which I have directed him to, in this and the former chapter: to ſpare my ſelf the paines of tranſcribing them.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there any thing, in all this, contrary to juſtice and equity, as<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> pretends: for, againſt whom is this injuſtice? Not againſt the creditor nor the ſurety: for it is by the conſent of them both that the debtor be not preſently diſcharged: and it is a known <hi>maxime, volenti non ſit injuria.</hi> Not againſt the debtor, for he hath not paid his debt; nor did the ſurety pay it with this purpoſe and will, that he (the ſaid debtor) ſhould be preſently diſobliged, but in convenient time. Yet that which follows, <hi>That the ſame debt cannot be paid and unpaid,</hi> is true; but nothing to the purpoſe: becauſe our queſtion is not whether payment or ſatisfaction be made; but whether he that payes for another may not agree with the creditor, that the perſon for whom he payeth ſhall not preſently be diſcharged, but at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time after? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> acknowledgeth. <q>That the effects of Chriſts death, as it is the meritorious price of faith, holineſſe, glory, are not preſent but future.</q> But was not the death of Chriſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:116045:132"/> price of our diſcharge from ſin and the curſe, as well as of thoſe bleſſings? and if Chriſt did merit them, to be given, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, but many years after his death, why not this?</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee how Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> illuſtrates this (for proofe we have none.)<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>As when a man that is a treſpaſſer, or any one for him, payes a ſumme of money, which is ſufficient, both for diſcharge of his treſpaſſe, as alſo for the purchaſe of a piece of land; from the treſpaſſe his diſcharge muſt be preſent, if the ſatisfaction be full, though the enjoyment of the land may be in</hi> Diem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. But neither yet do we hit the mark: for the queſtion is not, whether it be poſſible for a debtor to be diſcharged preſently and immediately upon the payment which another makes for him (which is the utmoſt this inſtance can reach to:) but whether it be not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him, not to be diſcharged upon ſuch a payment, preſently? which univerſal negative one particular inſtance can never well prove: eſpecially when other inſtances without number may be invented, which will infallibly prove the contrary. 2. Still I long to know the reaſon of that peremptory neceſſity, expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>From the treſpaſſe the diſcharge muſt be preſent, if the ſatisfaction be full. Caſſius</hi> hath <hi>Maevius</hi> in ſuite, for that his cattle have broke into his corne, and done him dammage to the value of 5. l. <hi>Lucius</hi> gives the ſaid 5. l. to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> that the next Term (and not before) he may diſcharge <hi>Maevius:</hi> which accordingly he doth. Is this contract im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible? If it be, ſhew us what contradiction there is in the tearms: if it be not, we are not bound to beleeve, that the diſcharge <hi>muſt needs be</hi> immediate, though Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſay it. 3. Nor yet am I able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (ſuch is my dulneſſe) why the effects of ſatisfaction ſhould be more immediate, then thoſe of merit: Eſpecially conſidering that the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is alſo the price of our peace and pardon: and that the difference between them is rather reſpective then real: the ſame obedience being called ſatisfaction, as it is ordered to Gods honour: and merit, as it is ordered to our benefit and advantage. The piece of land which one purchaſeth for another, might it not be enjoyed preſently, if the vendee and purchaſer did ſo agree? it might, (eſpecially if the price be full: as that is, which Chriſt paid for us many years ago.) Is it not then the agreement between the vendee and purchaſer which defers the poſſeſſion till ſuch a time? it is ſo. Why then ſhould not the caſe be the ſame in ſatisfaction? why (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) a debt cannot be paid and unpaid. No more can a price be paid and unpaid (ſay I). But neither doth the price nor ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:116045:133"/> produce their effects neceſſarily, or by way of natural cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but voluntarily according to the compact between the party paying and receiving: which if it did not hinder, the vendee were as much bound to give preſent poſſeſſion of the goods bought (having received the full price of them) as the creditor to forbear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of evil upon the treſpaſſer (upon ſatisfaction made by a third perſon.)</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Argument were ſomething if the ſinner himſelf had ſuffered according to the Law. As if it might be ſuppoſed that <hi>Adam</hi> after his ſin could by ſuffering have ſatisfied for his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: no doubt but he had been preſently reſtored into the ſame ſtate of favour which he was in before, and might have gone to work againe for life upon the ſecurity of the very ſame Covenant, with good ſucceſſe. And if Chriſt had paid the <hi>idem</hi> (a thing impoſſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were a ſinner, or we were Chriſt) then indeed had his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings delivered us <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and we had not needed a Covenant of grace to pardon or ſave us, but are in as good a capacity of life without it, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before he fell: as we have obſerved before. But that firſt Covenant being violated, and no ſatisfaction made (or poſſibly to be made) but by a voluntary ſurety; God is left at liberty (as I may ſo ſpeak) to propoſe what tearms and time he pleaſeth, for the reſtoring of ſinners into a ſtate of life and peace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22. Now when Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſays, that nothing hindred the reconciliation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with God but the breach of the Law, the ſpeech is ſomewhat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for though ſin made the breach between God and them, yet it is not that properly which hinders reconciliation, but the ſinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to make ſatisfaction: could he have ſatisfied, ſin could have had no power to have kept him at a diſtance from God: and ſo I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> mean, by his explication. God (ſaith he) having made a Law that the ſoul which ſins ſhall die, the juſtice and truth of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:116045:133"/> God required that ſatisfaction ſhould be made for the ſins of the elect, no leſſe then of other men. To the Argument therefore the anſwer is ready. If ſatisfaction were made ſo (which it was not) as that the Law had been anſwered in the very thing which it required, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinners puniſhment, then I would yeeld it wholly, and more then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will thank me for: namely that life is given us by the very ſame Covenant which was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency. But ſatisfaction being taken ſtrictly for a payment refuſable, which one is admitted to make for another; and then it produceth the effect of our reconciliation no otherwiſe, then as he that admitteth and he that is admitted to make payment ſhall agree. Wherefore I deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as being grounded in the former falſe ſuppoſal, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſatisfaction cannot be made in any way, but it muſt needs effect a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcharge: which I have already diſproved. The explication of this Argument I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd no fault with (more then that one expreſſion, <hi>That the onely cauſe of Chriſts death, was to ſatisfie the Law:</hi> whereas they that deny his death to have been ſatisfactory at all, do yet aſſigne many cauſes of his death, which our ſelves allow of) but there is nothing in it which tends to prove the thing denied, more then a compariſon or two, which need a little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

A neceſſity of obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by virtue of ſome Law or Covenant: but the onely Covenant which God made with man before the fall, was that made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, promiſing life upon perfect obedience. If by virtue of that Covenant God ſtands ſtill engaged to give life to men, ſuppoſing ſatisfaction to be made for diſobedience: then doth that Covenant made with man in innocency, ſtand ſtill in force as the onely way of life, and men (at leaſt the elect) are legally and in ſtrict juſtice as innocent as if they had never ſinned: both which are deſperately falſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:116045:134"/> and overthrow the very foundations of faith, or, 2. The neceſſity of a decree: God having decreed that the elect ſhall be reconciled immediately upon Chriſts ſatisfaction for their ſins; it muſt needs be that he having ſatisfied, they muſt be immediately reconciled. But the very ſuppoſing of ſuch a decree, is the begging of the queſtion: and being ſuppoſed, it will not inferre that the elect muſt needs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by the death of Chriſt immediately, <hi>quatenus</hi> it was a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but ſimply <hi>quatenus</hi> it was decreed to be immediately <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> to their reconciliation: or, 3. A kind of natural neceſſity: God being eſſentially good, cannot but do good to an innocent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creature, or to a ſinful creature, ſuppoſing ſatisfaction to be made for his ſin: which is all one, as if himſelf had never ſinned. But this is wider of truth then either of the former: for (whatſoever may be ſaid of it in reference to a creature perfectly righteous) out of doubt there was no other neceſſity of Gods accepting Chriſts ſatisfaction, then his own good pleaſure. He might juſtly have deſtroyed ſinners, and never provided a propitiation for them. It is therefore as clear as the Sun when the clouds are diſſolved, that there is no neceſſity of an immediate reconciliation between God and ſinners upon the death of Chriſt: but only of a reconciliation to follow then, and upon ſuch tearms as God and Chriſt agree. 2. Wherefore to the compariſon I anſwer: that Chriſt died not meerly to diſſolve and ſcatter the clouds of ſin; but to create a <note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 16. &amp; 65. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Obſerve one thing more (Reader) from M. <hi>Eyres</hi> application of his ſimilitude. <hi>So</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the cloud of our ſins being blotted out; the beams of Gods love have as free a paſſage towards us, as if we had not ſinned.</hi> What are theſe beams of love? Is pardon of ſin any of them? if it be, then behold the ſenſe of the compariſon: <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt having ſatisfied, God can now pardon ſin as freely as if men had no ſin, and ſo had never needed pardon. This is a rare notion: but there is yet ſomething worſe then non-ſenſe included in it; namely, that ſinners are diſcharged without pardon:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:116045:134"/> as having (in Chriſt) paid to the full the debt which they owed: as ſwearers and drunkards are diſcharged upon payment of the mulct enjoyned by Law, without the Magiſtrates pardon; and become from thenceforth immediately as capable of the benefit and protection of the Law, as if they had never broken it. If immediately upon Chriſts ſatisfaction the elect become in like manner as capable of the bleſſings of the promiſe as if they had never ſinned, there is then no need that they ſhould beleeve and repent in order to the obtaining of life and ſalvation.</p>

                        </gap>r that</hi> all have ſinned: which if M. <hi>Eyre</hi> will render <hi>in whom</hi> all have ſinned (as I deny not but he may by the help of an ellipſis, thus. Death paſſed upon all men by him in whom all have ſinned) yet will it be ſhort of his purpoſe. Doth not the Apoſtle ſay in the ſame verſe, <hi>Death hath paſſed upon all men?</hi> and <hi>v. 15. through the offence of one, many be dead:</hi> which <hi>many</hi> himſelf interprets of <hi>all.</hi> v. 18. for (as <hi>Beza</hi> notes well, <hi>v. 15.) many</hi> in this compariſon is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>all,</hi> but to <hi>one.</hi> Is it therefore lawfull to inferre, that men are actually dead before they are borne? Nothing leſſe. The meaning then of this ſpeech, <hi>All men are dead in Adam,</hi> is no more but this: That ſentence of death paſſed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> by virtue of which all that are borne of him, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> that they derive their being from him, become ſubject unto the ſame death. In like manner, all are ſaid to have ſinned in him: not that his poſterity then unborne and unbegotten (that is, no body) were immediately guilty of his fact: but becauſe by the juſt diſpenſation of God, it was to be imputed to them as ſoone
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:116045:135"/> as they had ſo much being as to be denominated children of <hi>Adam.</hi> His offence tainted the blood, and according to Gods Covenant and way of dealing with him, was interpreted as the act of the humane nature, then exiſting in himſelf (for <hi>tota natura generis eſt in qualibet ſpecie</hi>) but was neither imputed nor imputable to particular perſons partaking in that nature before their own perſonal exiſtence. In ſhort: we ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> no otherwiſe then we did exiſt in him; for <hi>operatio ſequitur eſſe:</hi> but to exiſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is not to exiſt ſimply, (but rather the contrary: for when men are men and have a perſonal exiſtence of their own, they exiſt no longer in <hi>Adam,</hi> but out of him: as every effect wrought exiſts out of its cauſes) but onely notes a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or power in him productive of us (<hi>poſitis omnibus ad ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If we apply this, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as no man partakes in <hi>Adams</hi> guilt, till he be borne a child of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo none partake in the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, nor the benefit of his ſatisfaction, till they be borne unto him by faith. And that doth the Apoſtle put out of queſtion in this very diſpute, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners;</hi> ſo by the obedience of one <hi>ſhall many be</hi> made righteous: which words were written many years after Chriſts death: and yet then there were many who in times and ages to come <hi>were to be</hi> made righteous by Chriſts obedience: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were not made righteous immediately in his death. That for the <hi>minor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The propoſition comes next to be canvaſed: where I deny that<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> there is the ſame reaſon for the tranſmiſſion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin and Chriſts righteouſneſſe to their reſpective ſubjects: for though both of them were heads and roots of mankind, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. and ſo farre forth they agree, both communicating their effects to their children: <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin and death to his natural children: Chriſt, righteouſneſſe and life to his ſpiritual children: yet the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame place ſhews that there is a divers diſſimilitude or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt them, and that in ſeveral reſpects, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18. particularly in that he calls our juſtification by the obedience of Chriſt the <hi>gift,</hi> and <hi>free gift</hi> in oppoſition to that <hi>judgement which by one came upon all to condemnation,</hi> v. 15, 16. implying the obedience of Chriſt to be ſo performed, as that there is yet required an act of <hi>grace</hi> on Gods part, to give us the effect of it: (as well as an act of faith on our part, that it may be given to us, or that we may receive it: of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:116045:135"/> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the next verſe, <hi>v. 17. They that receive abundance of grace—ſhall raigne in life:</hi> for we receive the grace of God by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.) ſuitable to what this Apoſtle had ſaid before, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 25, 26. that Chriſt was ſet forth to declare the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God—<hi>that he might be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> juſtifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth in Jeſus.</hi> But the effects of <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience came upon his poſterity by the neceſſity of the ſame judgement which paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, as the natural father of all men: ſo as there needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act, either on Gods part, or on our part; but <hi>eo ipſo</hi> that we are borne of <hi>Adam</hi> we become liable both to guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But of this we have ſpoken more largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Argument follows. <hi>If the ſacrifices of the Law were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>available for the typicall cleanſing under that adminiſtration; then the ſacrifice which Chriſt hath offered was immediately availeable, to make a real atonement for all thoſe ſins for which he ſuffered. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſequence is, becauſe the real ſacrifice is not leſſe efficacious then the typical. But thoſe legal ſacrifices did immediately make atonement without any condition performed on the ſinners part,</hi> Lev. 16. 30. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I except againſt the propoſition: becauſe there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the conſequence. The atonement made by ſacrifices might be available to an immediate cleanſing, though Chriſts be not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, 1. God might will the former, though not the latter. 2. The people cleanſed by ſacrifice were all in being. 3. And all actually guilty of thoſe ſins from which they were cleanſed by ſacrifice. 4. And the puniſhments from which they were delivered, were for the moſt part carnal and outward, and as it were preſent, being either actually upon them (as their, ſeparations from the congregation for leproſie or other defilements, ſuddaine plagues deſtroying multitudes of them &amp;c.) or in ſight (as it were) and neere at hand: in which reſpect it was neceſſary that the atonement made by ſacrifice ſhould have the more immediate effect. But they who are purged by the ſacrifice of Chriſt, many of them were not in being when his ſacrifice was offered, nor multitudes of them, yet much leſſe had they then committed thoſe ſins from which his ſacrifice doth afterwards purge them: nor is the puniſhment of their ſins already upon them, but put off in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of repentance. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will give me that liberty which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e takes himſelf, I might as well argue thus. If the ſacrifices under the Law obtained no pardon but for ſins committed, then neither doth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:116045:136"/> the ſacrifice of Chriſt obtaine preſent pardon for ſins to come, not yet committed. But the firſt is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the laſt. I doubt he would not grant my propoſition. The reaſon which he addes for confirmation of his own, hath no weight: for the efficacy of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices typical and real is rather to be meaſured by the greatneſſe of the effect wrought, then by their quickneſſe in working them. That ſacrifice is of greateſt efficacy which produceth the greateſt effect, whether it produce it immediately or no: for example. The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt is of greater efficacy then thoſe under the Law: becauſe they ſanctified to the purifying of the fleſh, but the blood of Chriſt purgeth the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 13, 14. But it did not purge our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences immediately as ſoon as it was offered: for we had then no conſciences to purge. Yet (I hope) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not ſay, that Chriſts ſacrifice is therefore of leſſe efficacy then the other.</p>
                  <p>But the aſſumption is that which I do moſt except againſt. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> That thoſe legal ſacrifices did immediately make atonement without any condition performed on the ſinners part. How doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove this? Thus: it is ſaid, <hi>Lev. 16. 30. the Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for you. Ergo,</hi> there was no condition required on the peoples part. But neither was the atonement perfectly made by the offering of the ſacrifice: but it was moreover required on the Prieſts part that he entred into the holy of holies, and made atonement there, to <hi>v.</hi> 12, 15. (a type of our Lords entrance into heaven to make reconciliation there for our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 24. and 2. 17, 18. and 4. 14, 15.) and on the peoples part, that they did upon that day humble and afflict their ſoules: otherwiſe they could not have any benefit by that atonement: as we have obſerved before out of <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 27, 28, 29. We have alſo already ſhewed that in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes ſome actions were required, as conditions without which ſinners received not the benefit of that typical atonement. But for the general this may ſuffice, that the people who received the benefit of thoſe ſacrifices were a people in Covenant with God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2. which was the grand condition of their partaking in the effects of that whole ceremonial ſervice, and were therein types of the ſpiritual worſhippers of the new Teſtament, who come by faith to the blood of ſprinkling, even to Chriſt crucified, for a ſpiritual and eternal cleanſing.</p>

                  <p>WE come now to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſeventh Argument. <q>Some of<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> the Elect are reconciled to God, immediately by the death of Chriſt, without any condition performed by them. <hi>viz.</hi> elect Infants.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the elect are ſo reconciled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the conſequence, becauſe it infers an univerſal from a particular. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>and through death to enter into Heaven:</hi> ſhall I ſay this is falſe, becauſe <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> went to Heaven, and never ſaw death? If the general directions, commands and promiſes in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, muſt all be arraigned of falſhood, if they be not applicable to Infants, as well as unto perſons that have underſtanding to know their Maſters will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall make ſad work: exceptions of particular perſons make no breach upon a general rule. The Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>He that will not work, muſt not eat:</hi> If we ſhould give Infants no more food then they work for, the world would be ſoon at an end.</p>
                  <p>2. But I deny the antecedent alſo. <hi>viz.</hi> That elect Infants are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt, without any condition performed on their part. A double anſwer therefore are our Divines wont to make to this objection. 1. That Infants may have the ſeed or habit of faith, though it be not wrought in them in the ordinary way of preaching. 2. That their Parents faith is the condition of their ſalvation, if they die before they are capable of putting forth the act of faith themſelves. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will not hear of either of theſe anſwers, but invades them both.</p>
                  <p>The former, 1. <q>Becauſe Infants <hi>have no knowledge of good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 39. and there cannot be faith without knowledge. 2. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing of the Word preach't, Rom.</hi> 10. Now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants heare not; or if they do, they underſtand not what they hear.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wilt thou ſee then (Reader) what is the aime and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of all Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> diſcourſe? this it is, that there is no neceſſity of believing or repenting, that men may be ſaved: for Infants are ſaved without it, as not being capable of ſo much as the habit of either: and <hi>God doth not give ſalvation unto Infants in one manner, and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:116045:137"/> to men in another;</hi> (theſe are his own words) therefore men alſo may be ſaved without it. 2. Or if he ſhall ſay (as he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe) that God hath purpoſed to give faith <hi>to all that are of yeares of diſcretion,</hi> before he give them ſalvation: yet ſtill we retort upon him what he requires of us, <hi>Let him clear it up from Scripture, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t him ſhew us the text that ſaith,</hi> that God hath purpoſed to <hi>have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in one way, and men in another.</hi> 3. And yet I know not whether he hath ſo much charity to Infants, as to allow them any room in the Kingdome of Heaven: he cannot, if his Argument be good; for the text is expreſſe, <hi>Mark 16. He that believeth not, ſhall be damned;</hi> and Infants are uncapable of believing: for <hi>they cannot hear the Word,</hi> nor have they <hi>any knowledge of good or evil:</hi> nor doth God <hi>ſave them in one way, and men in another.</hi> 4. But to what he ſpeaks here of the incapacity of Infants, having the <hi>ſeed or habit of grace,</hi> the anſwer is eaſie. It is true, they <hi>know neither good nor evil:</hi> but it will not follow (I trow) that they <hi>are neither good nor evil.</hi> They have the habits of ſin in them, even whiles they are uncapable of the act, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are capable of the habits of grace too: otherwiſe ſin and grace were not contraries; for <hi>contraria tribuuntur eidem.</hi> And it is certain, that as all are now borne in ſinne; ſo all ſhould have been borne righteous, if <hi>Adam</hi> (the father of us all) had not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
                  <p>And to the ſecond exception, <hi>viz. That faith cometh by hearing</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Word preached,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. the ſame anſwer will ſuffice: faith may be conſidered, either in its compleat act, (and ſo no doubt it comes by hearing; the reaſon is rendred by the Apoſtle in the ſame chapter, <hi>ver. 14. How ſhall they beleeve on him of whom they have not heard?</hi>) Or 2. In its ſeed, root or habit: and ſo I deny that it is alwayes and in all perſons, wrought by hearing of the Word preached. The Chriſtian and godly inſtructions of Parents, as they are ordained of God to be a meanes of inſtilling his feare into the hearts of their children, <hi>Eph. 6. 4. Iſa.</hi> 28. 9, 10, 11. ſo are they not unfrequently bleſſed with ſucceſſe, according to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of children, as in <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15. And ſometimes God by his own immediate working, may inſpire that grace into the heart of an Infant, which it is not poſſible any means ſhould be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men to effect. <hi>David</hi> ſeems to have been gracious from a childe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 9, 10. and 71. 5, 6. and <hi>Iſaac, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:116045:137"/> then deſire may be done, when they are ſaid to bleſſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>But we have a famous inſtance (which puts all out of doubt) of <hi>John</hi>

                     </q> and therefore is not to be drawn into an example, or urged as a rule to us, what to think of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</hi> We cite the words of <hi>v.</hi> 15.

But whereas he ſayes, it is not to be urged as a rule to us, what to think of other Infants; he ſhould have given us the reaſon too; for it proves invincibly, that Infants are capable of the habits of grace, (which is all intended to be proved by it) and by conſequence, that Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> two Arguments to the contrary, from Infants <hi>want of knowledge and inability to hear,</hi> are nothing worth. <note n="d" place="margin">Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But this inference will not paſſe: for it will be anſwered, That the Parents faith remains no longer the condition of his childes pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then during the ſtate of infancy: when he is growen up to the uſe of his own underſtanding and will, a perſonal faith of his own is required upon the ſame termes of neceſſity, as of others, who from their birth were without God, and ſtrangers from his Covenant. <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> is likened to a child, <hi>Ezek. 16. 5, 6, &amp;c. Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. and in Gods dealing with them there, (when they were in their Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age) we have a type and embleme of his dealing with other Infants, who are the children of his ſervants, and of ſuch as believe on him, after the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Their father <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, was the condition of their deliverance from the bondage of <hi>Egypt, Deut. 10. 15. Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he choſe their ſeed after them.</hi> And <hi>becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworne unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the houſe of bondmen,</hi> chap. 7, 8. Nevertheleſſe, after they had been farther inſtructed in, and known the Will of God, he required of them, that <hi>they ſhould feare, him, and walk in all his wayes, and love him, and ſerve him with all their heart and ſoule,</hi> Deut, 10. 12, 16. Otherwiſe they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a returne, to the ſame or a worſe bondage, then that out of which they had been redeemed, <hi>chap.</hi> 28. 65, 68. And it is alſo obſervable, that the Infants in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> continued their right to the promiſed land, while their Parents were cut off for rebellion, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14, 30, 31.</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:116045:138"/>
                  <p>As to the ſecond exception, <q>That we may as well aſſert works<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> of ſupererogation, as that one is juſtified by anothers faith.</q> I had thought Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had better underſtood what works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are, then to trouble us with ſuch an impertinency. But to the two texts of Scripture in the margine, to which he refers us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. to prove, that a mans faith or righteouſneſſe is available, only to his own ſalvation: they are both to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>pro ſubject â materiâ.</hi> He that is furniſhed with meanes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, for the exerciſe of a faith of his owne, or for performing works of righteouſneſſe, cannot expect ſalvation by the faith or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of his Parents, while himſelf lives in unbelief and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Argument is the old <hi>poſtulatum,</hi> that faith cannot be<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> the condition of our reconciliation, but it will then needs ſhare with Chriſt in the glory of this effect, which we have ſhewed already at large, to be contrary to the judgment of Scriptures, Reaſon, Lawyers, Divines, I may adde, of all ſorts of perſons. All men will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the freeſt Promiſe imaginable becomes not obligatory, but upon ſuppoſition of acceptance by him to whom the Promiſe is made: <note n="e" place="margin">Vide D Marta. Neapol. Digeſt. Noviſſ. Tom 3. Tit. Donatarius.</note> and the freeſt donation becomes invalid, if he to whom it is given will have none of it. And faith being no more then an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt, <hi>John 1. 12. Rev.</hi> 22. 17. one would think it might be made the condition of the gift of righteouſneſſe and life, without danger of ſharing in the glory of Chriſt. More of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſſe of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> crude aſſertion, (though it be more then needs, and more then once I intended) the Reader ſhall finde below, in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> nineteenth chapter.</p>
                  <p>Enter the ninth Argument. <q>If it were the Will of God, that<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> his people ſhould have ſtrong conſolation, and that their joy ſhould be full; then it was his Will, that their peace and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhould not depend upon conditions performed by themſelves; for it is impoſſible that any ſoul ſhould enjoy a firme and ſetled peace, whoſe confidence towards God is grounded upon conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promiſes: and (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>our ſalvation is by grace, to the end that the Promiſe may be ſure to all the ſeed,</hi> Rom. 4. 16.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We expect other manner of proof of the conſequence, then what is here preſented us, It is moſt true, that Gods Will is, that his people ſhould have ſtrong conſolation, not without faith, but through faith, as is moſt expreſſe in that very place which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> quotes, <hi>Heb. 6. 18. That we might have a ſtrong conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lation, who
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:116045:139"/> have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John, 1 Ep.</hi> 1. 4. gives the reaſon of his writing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, namely, that through the faith thereof <hi>our joy may be full.</hi> But it is the wildeſt reaſoning that ever I met with, to inferre, that if the gift of peace and reconciliation be ſuſpended upon believing, then he that believes cannot have ſtrong conſolation; juſt as if I ſhould inferre, becauſe the Lord ſayes, <hi>John 16. 24. Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full. Ergo,</hi> He that asketh can never attain to fulneſſe of joy. The ſtrength of our joy and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation depends upon the immutability and faithfulneſſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which we beleeve: and by how much the more ſtedfaſtly we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, by ſo much the more do we partake in the comfort of the Promiſe. But that is above all, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould quote, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. to prove, that if our ſalvation depended never ſo little upon our works, we could not be ſure thereof; (Amongſt which works he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes faith, abſurdly enough, but ſuitable to his dealing with the Authours whom he quotes here, and elſewhere, applying to faith what they ſpeak againſt works,) when the very words of the text are expreſly and purpoſely againſt the inference which he makes from them. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> Since man was borne upon the earth, was it ever thought poſſible that theſe words ſhould yield this inference? <hi>Ergo,</hi> if ſalvation depend on faith, we can never be ſure of it? Though neither doth the text ſpeak of the certainty of the ſubject, or of our being ſure of ſalvation: but of the certainty of the object, or of ſalvation's being ſure to us.</p>
                  <p>Let us hear the tenth Argument. <q>If it were the Will of God, that<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> the death of Chriſt ſhould be available for the reconciliation of the elect, whiles they live in this world; then it was his Will, that it ſhould procure for them immediate and actual reconciliation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of thoſe conditions, ſuppoſed to be required of them. The reaſon is, becauſe they cannot perform all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required of them, till their laſt breath: this being one, that they muſt perſevere to the end.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument (with many of the reſt) if it prove that ſinners are reconciled without any condition performed on their part, yet it doth not prove (what it ſhould do) that they are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled immediately in the death of Chriſt, or before they beleeve. If we contended for no more then that faith were antecedent to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, not the condition thereof; this Argument would not hurt
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:116045:139"/> us; and therefore is not like to be very ſerviceable to Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> 2. Nor doth it ſo much as pretend to diſprove Juſtification upon <hi>any</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, (as ſuppoſe upon the firſt act of faith) and therefore is yet farther impertinent. 3. But that which it would diſprove (if it had ſtrength enough) is the conditionality of final perſeverance unto Juſtification. But neither do we make final perſeverance the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our firſt Juſtification; but the firſt ſimple act of faith, and perſeverance in the faith to the end, the condition of final Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 7, 8.

But how doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove that a conditional reconciliation ſuppoſeth free-will? Thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Either God willed it unto men, upon a poſſible or impoſſible condition.</q>

But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſayes, we cannot mean it of a condition poſſible by Gods gift, <q>becauſe God will beſtow upon us nothing but what Chriſt hath purchaſed; and Chriſt hath purchaſed nothing, ſave what God hath promiſed in his Covenant: and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> denies that the Promiſe of faith is any part of the Covenant, or any effect of it, <hi>page</hi> 32. and others that are for this conditional reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, look upon it as a ridiculous conceit, that God ſhould promiſe men ſalvation upon a condition, and that he ſhould work this condition in them and for them.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw. Per varios caſus, per tot diſcrimina rerum, Tendimus in Latium.</hi> I do not wonder Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is ſo groſſely out, ſeeing he hath no ſhorter way to his Concluſion. It is very hard to me to conceive how this Argument proceeds: but thus I think it is. The thing which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> is proving is this, That no condition, or particularly, that faith is not a condition poſſible by the gift of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The proof ſtands thus, If God beſtow nothing but what Chriſt hath purchaſed, then faith is not a condition poſſible by the gift of God. But the firſt is true. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the laſt. The Propoſition ſtands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground. Chriſt (according to us) hath not purchaſed faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> if God beſtow nothing but what Chriſt hath purchaſed, he doth not beſtow faith. The Antecedent is thus proved. What God hath not promiſed in his Covenant, Chriſt hath not purchaſed. But God (according to us) hath not promiſed faith in his Covenant. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Chriſt hath not purchaſed it. This is the demonſtration. But yet we need ſeveral things to be demonſtrated. Firſt, that God gives nothing but what Chriſt hath purchaſed. 1. He gave Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a purchaſer, <hi>Eſa. 9. 6. To us a childe is borne, to us a Son is given.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denies Chriſt to have purchaſed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of remiſſion. 3. And our natural being and faculties will hardly be proved the fruit of Chriſts merits. 4. And ſuch of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, (who yet are neither Papiſts nor Arminians) who ſuppoſe faith to be an immediate effect of the ſame grace, with the giving of Chriſt to be our Redeemer, will yet need a farther proof of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition then I do. Secondly, that Chriſt hath purchaſed nothing, but what God hath promiſed in his Covenant, for the very making and enacting of the Promiſe or Covenant of grace, is the fruit of Chriſts Purchaſe, (whence his blood is ſo often called <hi>the blood of the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 10. 29. and 13. 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28.) 3. That I deny that the Promiſe of faith is any part or effect of the Covenant. I do indeed deny that it is an effect of the Covenant <hi>made with us,</hi> that is, that we are not in Covenant with God, when God promiſeth to give faith: but he promiſeth to give faith, that we may thereby be brought into Covenant with him. But the Covenant being taken largely, for a declaration of that whole good, which God will work in and for his people, and ſo God promiſeth faith: for explication of which, I muſt refer the Reader to the place where I purpoſely treat of it. In the mean time (Reader) hath not Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed his undertaking? Something, I perceive, he would faine faſten upon us: but his cord (his threefold cord) is made of burnt flax.</p>

                  <p>As for thoſe that look upon it as a ridiculous conceit, that God<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> ſhould promiſe ſalvation upon a condition which he worketh in us, is Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> of their minde, or is he not? If he be not, why doth he trouble us with them? If he be, why doth he fetch ſuch a compaſſe to come at his Concluſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But (according to us,) faith is the condition of ſalvation. <hi>Ergo.</hi> if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> think this Argument of the Remonſtrants unanſwerable, they will be much beholden to him.

Provided it be underſtood (as it ought) according to the difference which the ſame action hath, in reference to the univerſal, and its particular cauſe. Indeed it were ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that God ſhould make any action, which is wholly and immediately from himſelfe, the condition of any bleſſing he gives; as that he ſhould promiſe to glorifie us upon condition he raiſe us from the dead: to raiſe us, upon condition he juſtifie us: to juſtifie us, upon condition he give us faith. But the ſame faith which God worketh in us, is alſo our act (for it is we that beleeve, and not God, though he make us to beleeve) and as it is our act, ſo is it performed voluntarily, and a fit object of a command or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: I mean, capable of being commanded or rewarded, or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the condition of a reward. And thus (for example) obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was the condition of that life which was promiſed to <hi>Adam.</hi> (this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> grants.) Nevertheleſſe to the exerciſe of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the concurrence of God was neceſſary, as of the firſt cauſe: for creatures eſſentially depend on God, not only for their being, but for their motion and operation, <hi>Acts 17. 28. Ergo,</hi> a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act of ours may be the condition of our ſalvation, though God work that act in us. How many orders doth God give to <hi>Joſhua, Gideon, David</hi> and others, concerning the times and places, when and whither they ſhould remove their hoſt, that they might put their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the rout, or eſcape an overthrow by them.

Or 2. By comparing the effects with the cauſe, and one with another, and ſo that is the immediate effect of the death of Chriſt, which exiſts immediately upon the death of Chriſt, without the interpoſition of any other cauſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. Of this only is the Queſtion, as alſo Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelf hath hitherto underſtood it: otherwiſe I am perſwaded himſelf will grant, that all the Arguments he hath hitherto uſed (one or two at moſt only excepted) come not within ſight of the Concluſion they aime at.</p>

                     </gap>g which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould have diſproved, if he had intended his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have concluded any thing. We have already ſhewed at large the monſtrous inconveniences that attend the denial of it: and ſo much hath been ſpoken by thoſe that are for the middle way of univerſal redemption, eſpecially the French Divines, that I cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:116045:143"/> think it worth my labour to adde any thing more. The Lord Jeſus hath put the matter out of Queſtion to me, <hi>John 6. 39, 40. And this is the Fathers Will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day. And this is the Will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him may have everlaſting life, and I wil raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> The former verſe declares his own and his fathers ſpecial Will to ſave the elect. The latter, that yet the condition of beleeving is impoſed on all men (the elect, as well as others) that they through the performance thereof may be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we are come to the laſt Argument, which in brief is this,<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> 
                     <q>The imputing of our ſins to Chriſt was formally the non-imputing of them unto us. But our ſins were accounted or imputed to Chriſt without any condition on our part. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are diſcounted or non-imputed to us, without any condition performed by us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Propoſition, namely, that the imputing of our ſins to Chriſt, is formally the non-imputing of them unto us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 1. If this be true, then doth not God for Chriſts ſake forgive any mans ſin, as the Apoſtle ſaith he doth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 32. the reaſon is plain, becauſe it was not for Chriſts ſake that himſelf was puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our pardon is not the effect of Chriſts puniſhment, but on the contrary, his puniſhment is the effect of our pardon, if the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our ſins to him be formally the non-imputation of them to us. 2. What then is the meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer for them that deſerted him? 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. The Lord grant that it may not be imputed to them:</hi> that is, the Lord grant that Chriſt may be puniſhed for them? or what is the meaning? The Lord grant they may be ſome of thoſe for whom Chriſt hath been puniſhed? that were all one as to pray that they may be elected from all eternity. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſe M. <hi>Eyre</hi> will put upon the words, it will either not agree with ſenſe, or not with himſelf, or not with the text. 3. Upon the ſame principle it will follow, that the death of Chriſt as it was a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and his reſurrection from the dead contributes nothing to our juſtification, neither by way of influence, nor by way of evidence: for might it be ſuppoſed that the Lord Jeſus had lyen for ever under the power of death, <hi>that</hi> had been the beſt <hi>evidence</hi> to us that we ſhould never be puniſhed, if his puniſhment were formally our <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nition:</hi> and by way of influence it can do nothing, becauſe Gods
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:116045:143"/> freeing or taking off puniſhment from us is in nature before his laying it on Chriſt, if the imputing it to Chriſt be formally the <hi>non</hi>-imputing it to us: many other inconveniences attend this doctrine: but it is needleſſe to inſiſt upon the mention of them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Arguments, there are ſeveral teſtimonies of Scripture<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> which M. <hi>Eyre</hi> mentions, to prove our reconciliation to be the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and immediate effect of Chriſts death: let us view them, <hi>Coloſ. 1. 14. Eph. 1. 7. Heb. 9. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and 10. 12, 14. <hi>Coloſ. 2. 10, 13, 14. Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We have already anſwered at large to <hi>Rom. 8. 33, 34. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. Eph.</hi> 1. 7. and by conſequence to <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 14. for the words are the ſame in both thoſe places. We have therefore here to anſwer no more then the texts out of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and one out of the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> let us take them in order, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. Chriſt <hi>hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal redemption for us.</hi> I cannot aſſure my ſelf how M. <hi>Eyre</hi> underſtands this text: but if he ſee no more in it then all men I can meet with, he can conclude no more from it then what was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, namely that Chriſt hath purchaſed eternal redemption for us. But he hath alſo purchaſed eternal life and glory for us: will it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that our glorification, is the actual and immediate effect of his death? he gave himſelf to redeem us from all iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. are we therefore freed from all ſin immediately in his death?</p>
                  <p>The next is <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Chriſt <hi>by himſelf hath purged our ſins, and afterwards ſate down</hi> as having finiſhed that work, <hi>Heb. 10. 12.

But that this purge had its effect immediately upon its own exiſtence, is that which M. <hi>Eyre</hi> muſt give us another Text to prove: whereas he addes, that he <hi>afterwards ſate down</hi> as having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if M. <hi>Eyre</hi> mean that he hath ſo perfectly reconciled us in his death (not only <hi>quoad conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem cauſae,</hi> but <hi>quoad effectum</hi>) as that there needs nothing more

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now come to the review of thoſe two Arguments<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> mentioned in my Sermon, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> made uſe of to prove that the elect were juſtified before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving. The former in ſhort I thus propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>If we are juſtified in Chriſt, then we are juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we beleeve. But we are juſtified in Chriſt, <hi>Ergo.</hi> This Argument Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> propoſeth more at large in his anſwer to my Sermon: ſhewing withal how each part was proved in his conference with me, (concerning which I am able to give the Reader no account: having ſo perfectly forgotten the method he uſed in propoſing and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:116045:145"/> his Argument) the ſumme is, Chriſt was juſtified in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as a common perſon: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the elect were then juſtified in him.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer to this in my Sermon is large and diſtinct. The ſumme is: if juſtification be taken properly, I deny that we were juſtified in Chriſt: if improperly, I deny that it will follow, that we were juſtified before faith, becauſe we were juſtified in Chriſts reſurrection, no more then it will follow, that becauſe we are ſaid to be riſen with Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> men are riſen from the dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are borne, or dead, or while they are lying in their graves. But becauſe M. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath taken my anſwer in pieces, let us ſee what he doth animadvert upon each part of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, I ſay we may conceive of a threefold juſtification. 1. A juſtification purpoſed in the decree of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. 2. A juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation purchaſed and impetrated in the death of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. 3. A juſtification exemplified in the reſurrection of Chriſt: who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was juſtified in his own reſurrection, and thereby became the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary cauſe of juſtification to beleevers, by virtue whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall alſo be juſtified in due time, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What ſays Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to this? 1. He infers in general, that then by my own confeſſion, juſtification in a Scripture ſenſe goes before faith. The vanity of which triumph we have already diſcovered, <hi>chapt.</hi> 1. §. 2. ſhould I ſay that our glorification may be conceived as purpoſed of God, as purchaſed by Chriſt, as exemplified in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; I ſhould not count him worthy of a reply that ſhould inferre, that I had therefore yeelded glorification to be before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> therefore foreſeeing that I would deny either of theſe to be actual juſtification, tells his Reader before hand that, <hi>That were a poore put off, becauſe</hi> omnis juſtificatio ſimpliciter dicta congruenter exponenda eſt de juſtificatione actuali. Analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro famoſiori ſignificato. <hi>When we ſpeak of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ſimply, there is no man but underſtands it of actual justification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which makes me beleeve his report concerning his book (at leaſt ſome parts of it) that <hi>it had coſt him but little paines:</hi> for I cannot ſee how ſuch obſervations could coſt him much. I mention juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>cum adjecto</hi> with a limitation: and in the cloſe of my anſwer, oppoſe each branch of my diſtinction to juſtification <hi>ſimply ſo called;</hi> and this I may not be allowed to do, becauſe of <hi>Analogum per ſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nextly, He ſpeaks ſomething on each member of the diſtinction,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> and ſays, <q>1. <hi>That which I called juſtification, purpoſed in the decree of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:116045:145"/> God is real and actual juſtification.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou haſt then thy choiſe (Reader) whether thou wilt beleeve, the Apoſtle or M. <hi>Eyre.</hi> The Text quoted (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8.) ſays thus: The Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Gentiles through faith, preached before, the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> The juſtification here ſpoken of, is ſurely juſtification ſimply ſo called, becauſe it is put by it ſelf, without any Term of reſtraint or diminution: and M. <hi>Eyres</hi> rule is, <hi>Analogum per ſe poſitum ſtat pro famoſiori ſignificato.</hi> And this juſtification (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle) was a thing <hi>foreſeen:</hi> a thing that God <hi>would do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> a thing <hi>before the exiſtence of which</hi> the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> all which notwithſtanding, M. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God to be our juſtification. But of this we have ſpoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as alſo of what he notes upon the ſecond branch of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The great exception is againſt the third branch, wherein I ſay, that<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> Chriſt in his reſurrection being himſelf juſtified, became thereby an exemplary cauſe of a juſtification future to them that ſhould beleeve. I did little expect ſo much vehemency and acrimony in oppoſing this, as I meet with in M. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>1. (Saith M. <hi>Eyre</hi>) there is not the leaſt hint thereof in holy writ: the Scripture no where calls our Saviour the example or patern of our juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> If the Queſtion be concerning a name or term, where doth M. <hi>Eyre</hi> find in Scripture the Term of a <hi>common perſon</hi> (in which he ſo much delights) attributed to Chriſt? 2. If concerning that which is equivalent; ſurely, the Term of an exemplary cauſe, is every whit as agreeable to Scripture as the other: for in all ſpiritual and eternal bleſſing <hi>we beare the image of the heavenly Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 49. and we are <hi>predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of Chriſt,</hi> from the beginning to the end of our faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 17. Now wherin we bear Chriſts image, therein was he an exemplary cauſe; for to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary cauſe no more is required then that another thing be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it, as its image, and exiſt by virtue of it (which I deſire the Reader to obſerve, becauſe M. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth often confound an <hi>example</hi> with an <hi>exemplary cauſe,</hi> as if there were no difference between them.) If then we in our reſurrection and juſtification bear the image of Chriſt, then he in his reſurrection and juſtification was the exemplary cauſe of ours. And whereas M. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſays, <q>that Chriſt in his works of mediation was not an exemplary, but a meritorious cauſe:</q> it is not univerſally true. For the reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:116045:146"/> were acts of Chriſts as Mediatour: and yet in them he was not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of any thing.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds thus. <q>It was needleſſe Chriſt ſhould be a patern<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> of our juſtification: for this patern muſt be of uſe, either unto us, or unto God. Not to us, becauſe we do not juſtifie our ſelves: not to God, becauſe he needs no patern to direct him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The disjunction is imperfect: for it was needful for the glory of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſly witneſſeth, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many brethren.</hi> It is no ſmall part of Chriſts glory to be the firſt begotten from the dead, and a perſon ſo farre advanced above all others, that their higheſt glory ſhall conſiſt in a conformity to him, and in being faſhioned according to his image. 2. It is alſo of as much uſe to us in all reſpects, as if we are ſaid to be juſtified in Chriſts reſurrection as a common perſon: whether we reſpect the evidence which his reſurrection gives, or the influence which it hath upon our juſtification. And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaies it can be of no uſe to us, <hi>becauſe we do not juſtifie our ſelves,</hi> it is a ſtrange kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Cannot a ſoul by faith behold the <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>glorious effects</hi> of his juſtification (notwithſtanding all the oppoſition of ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) by looking on Chriſt juſtified as an exemplary cauſe, to whom himſelf alſo ſhall be conformed in one time?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> argues againſt it thus. <hi>He that pays our debts</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>to the utmoſt farthing, and thereupon receives a diſcharge, is more then a paterne of our releaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep. More</hi> then a patern of our releaſe? Is this all Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for? upon what pretence then doth he oppoſe me? I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Chriſt to be the meritorious cauſe of our releaſe in his death, and not only the exemplary cauſe of it in his reſurrection. As to the thing which (I think) Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> intends, I have told him often, that Chriſt entred into an obligation of his own to make ſatisfaction for our debt: from which obligation he was diſcharged in his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God acquitting him, as having paid as much as was demanded. But if Chriſt had <hi>power to do what he would with his own;</hi> then was it in his power and his Fathers, to give us the effect of this ſatisfaction, when and upon what tearms they pleaſed: and to ſuſpend our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge (notwithſtanding Chriſt were long before diſcharged) till himſelf ſhould ſit down at the right hand of Glory, and give it us with his own hand, according as ſinners in ſucceſſive generations come to him for it. M. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath often ſaid the contrary, but proves it no where.</p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:116045:146"/>
                  <p>His third Argument chargeth high (<hi>magnis tamen excidit auſis:</hi>)<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> take it at large. <hi>If Chriſt were only a patern and example of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then was he juſtified from his own ſins, and conſequently was a ſinner, which is the moſt horrid blaſphemy that can be uttered. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſequence is evident: for if Chriſt was but a patern of our juſtification, then was he juſtified as we are. Now we are juſtified from our own ſins which we our ſelves have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. This the charge: this the proofe. But becauſe M. <hi>Eyre</hi> is ſo careleſſe of what he ſpeaks, let us ſee whether the matter be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his own principles. He then doth not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but contend that the elect were juſtified in Chriſt as a common perſon. Now what is a common perſon? It is a general tearm, and ſhould have been deſcribed more plainly then it is: but ſomething he ſpeaks of him, §. 1. Whatſoever is done by or to a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſuch, is to be attributed to them in whoſe ſteed he ſtands, and §. 4. 1. The act of a common perſon is the act of them whom he repreſents. The ſumme is. A common perſon is he that repreſents another both in what he doth, and in what is done to him. Now then thus I proceed. If Chriſt were juſtified as a common perſon, then was he juſtified from his own ſins, and conſequently was a ſinner, which is the moſt horrid blaſphemy that can be uttered. The reaſon of the conſequence is evident: for if Chriſt was juſtified as a common perſon, then was he juſtified as we are (for a common perſon is he that repreſents another both in what he doth, and in what is done to him) Now we are juſtified from our own ſins, which we our ſelves have committed. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Let M. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwer this for himſelf, and he hath anſwered for me. But becauſe he hath put me out of hope of the former, I will do the latter preſently. 2. In the mean time I will propoſe one thing to M. <hi>Eyres</hi> conſideration. If the juſtification of Chriſt as a common perſon were actually, and formally the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the elect, then are not the elect juſtified of grace but of works: (which is the moſt horrid contradiction to the Goſpel that can be uttered:) the reaſon of the conſequence is evident: becauſe Chriſt was not juſtified of grace but of debt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if that act of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which paſſed upon him, be that which juſtifies us, then are not we juſtified of grace.</p>
                  <p>But to M. <hi>Eyres</hi> Argument (if it may ſo be called) I deny his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> (as evident as it is) and the proofe of it. To the former I ſay, that Chriſts reſurrection was his diſcharge from <hi>his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obligation,</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:116045:147"/> which he voluntarily undertooke to ſuffer and ſatisfie for our ſins: and therein he became the exemplary cauſe of a like diſcharge which ſhould follow on them that beleeve, from that obligation which comes upon them involuntarily and neceſſarily becauſe of ſin. To the proof I ſay, that Chriſts Juſtification was ſuch as ours is, in regard of its common nature and effects, (which is ſufficient to the agreement of the example and counterpart: as the ſacrifices of old repreſented Chriſt dying, though he were a man, and they were beaſts) not in its principle and ſpecial nature. Surely it will not be denied, that we beare the image of Chriſt in our reſurrection from the dead: but then (will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſay) he was raiſed as we are: now we are raiſed from corruption. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he alſo was raiſed from corruption, which is as horrid a contradiction to Scripture as can be uttered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 10. or he was raiſed by his own power, <hi>John 2. 19. Ergo,</hi> if we in our Reſurrection are conformed to him, then are we alſo raiſed by our own power; which is blaſphemy as bad as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that makes Chriſt as bad as ſinners; this makes ſinners as good as Chriſt. Did M. <hi>Eyre</hi> think it poſſible to convince mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings by ſuch Argumentations as theſe? His fourth Argument is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point all one with this, and hath been anſwered already over and over, in that wherein it differs from this.</p>
                  <p>His fifth Argument is. <q>That I recede very far both from the<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> meaning and expreſſions of all our orthodox writers, who do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly call our Saviour a common perſon,</q> but never the exemplary cauſe of our juſtification: particularly my Grandfather Parker, <hi>de deſcenſ. lib. 3. ſect.</hi> 49, 50, 53.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I did not think before (nor do I now) that the affirming of Chriſt to be an exemplary cauſe of all thoſe ſpiritual heavenly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which God beſtows on us, had been, to deny him to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon. The Scriptures call him <hi>the firſt borne amongſt many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Rom. 8. 29. <hi>The firſt borne of every creature,</hi> Coloſ. 1. 15. <hi>the firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. phraſes importing that there are many others, who by his power ſhall be conformed to his image in all his heavenly perfections: which is all I ſeek by the tearm of an exemplary cauſe. But he that calls Chriſt the firſt borne, the firſt begotten, the firſt fruits, is ſo far from denying him, as that he doth ſuppoſe him to be a common perſon, in regard that the proper import of theſe phraſes is to teach us, that he hath received excellent bleſſings, not for himſelf, but for others alſo. The reaſon why I uſe the tearm of an exemplary cauſe rather then of a common perſon, I
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:116045:147"/> give the Reader a little below. 2. And that our Divines do uſually call Chriſt a common, perſon is a thing ſo well known, that M. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould not need to have quoted my Grandfather <hi>Parker</hi> to convince me of it. He ſhould have ſhewed that they call him ſo in ſuch a ſenſe as cannot be expreſſed by the tearm of an exemplary cauſe. So doth not my Grandfather, at leaſt in the point of Chriſts reſurrection, of which he there ſpeaks not a word: but <note n="m" place="margin">Do deſcenſ. lib. 4 ſect. 75.</note> elſewhere ſaies with <hi>Athanaſius.

But if I, who thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Lords merits and ſatisfaction, and live by the faith thereof, am yet guilty of Pelagianiſme and Socinianiſme for affirming, that as in all things elſe, ſo in his juſtification he had this preeminence above others, as not only to be juſtified himſelf, but to become the juſtifying cauſe of others after his own paterne and ſimilitude; I am content to beare the reproach of both.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place I gave the Reader an account why I uſed the<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> tearme of an exemplary cauſe, rather then of a common perſon, in theſe words. I uſe the tearme of an exemplary cauſe rather then
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:116045:148"/> of a common perſon, becauſe a common perſon may be the effect of thoſe whom he repreſents (as the Parliament of the Common-wealth) but Chriſt is ſuch a common perſon, as that he is the cauſe of thoſe whom he repreſents in every thing in which he repreſents them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This excuſe (ſaith M. <hi>Eyre</hi>) is both fallacious and impertinent. Fallacious, becauſe it ſeems to intimate, that an exemplary cauſe doth expreſſe as much as a common perſon: which is clearly falſe: for the act of the exemplar is not the act of the Imitator; as the act of a common perſon is the act of them whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents.</q> Parents are examples to their children, not common perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Know (Reader) firſt, that we are not now ſpeaking of our active, voluntary imitation of Chriſt in duties of obedience: but of our being paſſively conformed and faſhioned like him in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his ſpiritual bleſſings, according to our condition and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Thus in our juſtification do we bear his image and partake in his likeneſſe; who as he was the firſt borne from the dead, ſo is he the firſt borne of them that are juſtified, foraſmuch as his reſurrection was his juſtification. And as our reſurrection from death (whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall be) exiſts by virtue of his, <hi>Joh 14. 19. He being riſen as the firſt fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. So alſo doth our juſtification. 2. This being premiſed I adde, that to ſay that Chriſt in his reſurrection was the exemplary cauſe of our juſtification is far more pertinent and ſignificant, then to ſay, we were then juſtified in him as a common perſon (eſpecially according to M. <hi>Eyres</hi> uſe of that tearme, of which more preſently:) the reaſon is ready; becauſe the former phraſe expreſſeth the influence which his juſtification hath upon ours, and the dependance which ours hath upon his, which the latter doth not; for to be juſtified in another as a common perſon, doth neither declare his juſtification to be the cauſe of ours, nor ours the effect of his: could we have delegated a perſon to have received from God that ſentence of abſolution in our names (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent up <hi>Moſes</hi> into the mount) we had all of us been juſtified as immediately as himſelf, nor had our juſtification had any dependance upon his, though we had then been juſtified in him as a common perſon. 3. Wherefore, as to the tearme of a common perſon (concerning which I have made a more toyleſome ſearch into the civil law, and thoſe few Civilians which I have, then the moment of the matter requires) it may be underſtood in a double ſenſe: either, 1. <hi>fictione ſuppoſiti,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:116045:148"/> when a perſon (by a kinde of civil <hi>metempſeuchoſis</hi>) doth ſo repreſent another, in what he doth, or is done to him, as that the ſame things are ſaid to be done by, or to the perſon whom he repreſents. As Ambaſſadours repreſent the perſon of the Princes that employ them: what they do <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is reputed the act of the Prince that ſends them forth, and what is done to them <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is reputed as done to him. We do, or receive that, which our Attorney doth, or receives in our name. Or 2. <hi>Ex re geſtâ,</hi> when a perſon doth that, in the effects of which (be they good or evil) others partake as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus the puniſhment of high treaſon is common with the Traitour to his children, though he do not repreſent them, neither in offending, nor in being puniſhed. Thus a Surety payes his money as a common perſon, becauſe the Debtour (as well as himſelf) if no compact hinder) hath the benefit of a diſcharge, though he do not repreſent the debtour in making payment. In this latter ſenſe I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge, that Chriſt was a common Perſon in his Death and Reſurrection, becauſe we receive the benefit of both in our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and kinde as well as himſelf And in this ſenſe an exemplary cauſe expreſſeth as much and ſomewhat more then a common perſon.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will have Chriſt to be a common perſon in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> ſenſe: and that as well in his Death as his Reſurrection. That he was ſo in his death, I deny roundly. The reaſon is that, for which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> chooſeth to call him a common perſon, rather then an exemplary cauſe, becauſe (ſaith he) the act of a common perſon is the act of them whom he repreſents. But Chriſts ſatisfaction, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, redemption, and perfect obedience, are not our act, ſo as that we can be ſaid to have ſatisfied, merited, redeemed our ſelves, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed the Law, and borne the curſe thereof, (things for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impoſſible for ſinners to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and 5. 6.) <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not repreſentable as doing of them. Would Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would give an example amongſt men of a common perſon, repreſenting others in ſuch an act which is impoſſible for them to put forth; But the Scripture is expreſſe, that as it was by the one offence of one man that all are condemned; ſo is it by the one righteouſneſſe of one Jeſus Chriſt, that all are juſtified, <hi>Romanes</hi> 5. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>The Reſurrection of Chriſt I acknowledge to be of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> and that he may with much more reaſon be ſaid to be a common perſon in his Reſurrection, then in his death. Nevertheleſs,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:116045:149"/> neither in that do I approve the tearme, (unleſſe it be underſtood in the ſecond ſenſe mentioned) for the reaſon already given. And to what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> addes, of Parents being examples to their children, he muſt again remember that I am not contending that Chriſt is the <hi>example,</hi> but the <hi>exemplary cauſe</hi> of our Juſtification. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are ſet forth for <hi>examples</hi> of what judgements God will execute upon ſuch ſinners, but they are not exemplary cauſes thereof. This for the fallacie.</p>
                  <p>2. (Saith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) it is impertinent, <q>becauſe Chriſts diſcharge<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> may be ours, though we did not chooſe him, but God did conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and appoint him to be the Head, Surety, and common Perſon to the Elect. We did not chooſe <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet his ſin was imputed to us.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Nor do I intend any thing more in changing the terme of a common perſon into that of an exemplary cauſe, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that preheminence which Chriſt hath, as in all things elſe, ſo in his Juſtification; which the terme of a common perſon is ſo farre from doing, as that it ſuppoſeth the juſt contrary; for the action or paſſion of a common perſon is not ſo properly his own, as his whom he repreſents. As, what an Ambaſſadour doth is not ſo properly his own act as the Kings, and what is done to him <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly done to the King then to him. In like manner, if Chriſt were raiſed preciſely as a common perſon repreſenting us, then are we properly the <hi>firſt riſers</hi> from the dead, and his Reſurrection hath no cauſal influence at all upon ours. 2. That God appointed his Sonne to be the Head, Surety, and common Perſon of the Elect, is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; if a common perſon be taken in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe, for one that repreſents others in what he doth, and in what is done to him; Chriſt is undoubtedly a Head and Surety to the Elect; ſo the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures call him, and both expreſſions imply a cauſal influence of life from him to us; But the common Perſon deſcribed <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is neither Head nor Surety, becauſe the operations of a Head and Surety are his own peculiarly: none other do the like, and therefore are not capable of being repreſented in doing of them: the caſe is the ſame in what he receives, or in what is done to him, as Head and Surety. 3. Concerning <hi>Adam,</hi> I do alſo deny that he is fitly called a common perſon in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſenſe of that phraſe: and in what ſenſe we may be ſaid to have ſinned in him, we have already largely opened. His ſin is indeed imputed unto us: not that it is imputed to us that we have done it or committed it, for that is in it ſelfe an errour of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:116045:149"/> falſhood: and beſides is contrary to the Apoſtle, who ſuppoſeth this ſin to be imputed unto many, <hi>who never ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion,</hi> neither <hi>in individuo,</hi> nor <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> Rom. 5. 14. but becauſe by vertue of that ſin we his children ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the ſuffering of death natural: he being the common Parent, who by Covenant received righteouſneſſe and life to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his children, if himſelf continued obedient, otherwiſe to loſe it, both to himſelf and us.</p>
                  <p>That the Reader might ſee how inconſequent Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> argument<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> is, inferring our Juſtification before ſaith, from our Juſtification (in ſome ſenſe) in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, I ſaid, we may as juſtly inferre that our Reſurrection is paſt already, becauſe we are riſen in Chriſt, as that our Juſtification is paſt before we beleeve, becauſe we are (in ſome ſenſe) juſtified in Chriſt. We are alſo in ſome ſenſe ſanctified in Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 6. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. yet we may not infer, <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are ſanctified before faith.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſpeaks many words to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the ſumme of them is, <q>Our perſonal Reſurrection ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſeth our life and death. But to our actual diſcharge there needed no more then the payment of our debt, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The difference between our Reſurrection and Sanctification on the one hand, and Juſtification on the other, is plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the whole ſtrength of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Argument lieth in this one thing, that we were juſtified in Chriſt as a common perſon. Now if our riſing in Chriſt as a common perſon, will not infer that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is before faith, then neither is our Juſtification proved to be before faith, becauſe we were juſtified in Chriſt as a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and if we were juſtified <hi>ſimply</hi> in his Reſurrection, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t muſt be upon ſome other account, then becauſe we were juſtified in him as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon. 2. Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth tacitly deny, (not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for feare of the people) that we are riſen in Chriſt as a common perſon. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fully merited our Reſurrection to glory, in which reſpect we are ſaid to be riſen with Chriſt,</hi> (a ſtrange and unheard of interpretation, that we ſhould be ſaid to be raiſed with Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he in his death merited our Reſurrection, which might have been true, though himſelf had never been raiſed) but Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> might eaſily foreſee, that as he interprets our Reſurrection in Chriſt, ſo might we interpret our Juſtification in Chriſt riſing, (a phraſe not uſed in Scripture, but admitted by me as agreeable, or not contrary
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:116045:150"/> thereunto,) not for our Juſtification in him as a common perſon, but for his merit or purchaſe of our Juſtification. Truly this doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> own too, (though very privately) and thereby quite and clean deſert his whole argument in the very next words. <hi>It is,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no ſuch abſurdity to ſay, Chriſt hath purchaſed our R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though we are not riſen, as to ſay, he hath purchaſed our diſcharge, and yet we are not diſcharged; for to ſay a debt is diſcharged, and yet juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeable, is a contradiction.</hi> Purchaſed? why I thought we had been now diſputing whether the diſcharge of Chriſt as a common perſon in his Reſurrection, were really and formally the diſcharge of ſinners? and not whether he purchaſed our diſcharge in his death? But ſome men had rather ſpeak nothing to purpoſe, then nothing at all. As to the reaſon added, we have already ſhewed at large, in what ſenſe Chriſts death, may be called the payment of our debt. A debtour cannot diſcharge a debt, and yet that debt be juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon him: but that another may not leave a full and ſufficient price in the Creditors hand, that he may diſcharge his debtour ſome time after that price is paid, or upon ſome condition to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, I ſhall beleeve, when I ſee, not words, but power and argument: which I have long in vaine expected from Maſter <hi>Eyre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Concluſion therefore, and ſumme of my Anſwer was this, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> is either cauſal and virtual, or actual and formal: we were cauſally and virtually juſtified in Chriſts Juſtification, but not actually and formally.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer is nothing but a repetition of ſeveral things (already confuted) concerning the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, and the payment and ſatisfaction in his death: but upon the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf he fixeth nothing. By all which, I perceive, he is weary of his argument drawen from Chriſts Juſtification in his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to prove ours. I ſpeak of a Juſtification virtual and cauſal in Chriſts Reſurrection, and he anſwers I know not what, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts death. Yet the latter part of the anſwer deſerves a little conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I grant (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) that the death of Chriſt doth juſtifie us only virtually; but the ſatisfaction in his death doth juſtifie us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally.—And therefore <hi>Chriſts dying for us, or for our ſins,</hi> his reconciling us to God, and our being juſtified, are <hi>Synonyma</hi>'s in Scripture phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 58, 9, 10.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. The diſtinction here propoſed I never reade before, nor
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:116045:150"/> can I underſtand now, <hi>viz.</hi> How we are juſtified virtually in the death of Chriſt, as it was his death, not as it was a ſatisfaction in whole or part. If the meaning be that there was that vertue and worth in the death of Chriſt as made it ſatisfactory, which no mans death elſe could be for want of the like worth: yet is the ſpeech ſtrangely improper. As if a broken undone debtour, ſeeing a very wealthy man that hath many thouſands more lying by him, then his debt comes to, ſhould ſay, his debt is virtually paid, or himſelf vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcharged by that mans money. 2. To ſay that Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction doth juſtifie us formally, is to deny our Juſtification for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to be Gods act, (for it was not God but Chriſt that ſatisfied) or that it doth at all conſiſt in the pardon of ſin (for Chriſt did not ſatisfie by having any ſin pardoned to him) or that he was juſtified before us: yea rather, we are firſt juſtified, if his ſatisfaction juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us formally: becauſe himſelf was not properly juſtified till his Reſurrection. I have often read that Chriſts ſatisfaction juſtifies us materially, being that matter or righteouſneſſe for which we are juſtified; never till now, that it juſtifies formally. 2. The next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that <hi>Chriſts dying for us,</hi> or <hi>for our ſins,</hi> and <hi>our being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,</hi> are <hi>Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nyma</hi>'s in Scripture, is moſt plainly refuted by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Rom. 4. 25. who was delivered,</hi> (namely, unto death) <hi>for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> undertakes the anſwer of an objection,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> not made by me, but by ſome others, and it is here brought in by head and ſhoulders, without the leaſt occaſion offered, ſaving what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath made to himſelf, by forgetting his own argument and the right proſecution thereof; and deflecting from our Juſtification in Chriſt as a common perſon, to the Purchaſe of Juſtification in his blood. Nevertheleſſe, becauſe the truth is on the objectours ſide, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> in anſwering contradicts himſelf, let us ſee what is ſaid. The objection is this, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 21. Chriſt was made ſin for us,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that we might be made</hi> (he doth not ſay, that thereby we are made,) <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God in him. Ergo,</hi> the laying of our ſinnes on Chriſt is only an Antecedent, which tends to the procuring of our Juſtification, and not the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally.</p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt (Reader) that the ſcope of the objection is to prove, that the death of Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification, which Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> after frequent acknowledgements of the truth of it, doth now plainly deny: and that of Juſtification not as ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:116045:151"/> the act but the effects. What, have we heard ſo often of Chriſts procuring, meriting, purchaſing Pardon and Redemption, when he is here denied to have done any thing, tending to the <hi>procuring</hi> of our Juſtification? But let us ſee Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer: it conſiſts of three parts.</p>
                  <p>1. (Saith he) <q>That this phraſe, <hi>that we might be,</hi> or <hi>be made,</hi> doth not alwayes ſignifie the final, but ſometimes the formal cauſe:</q> as when it is ſaid, That light is let in, that darkneſſe may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But in this ſenſe is that phraſe very rarely, if at all, uſed in the New Teſtament, and improperly, whereſoever it is uſed: and thrice in this chapter, but a little before, uſed in its moſt obvious ſenſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. 12, 15. and in this text cannot have that ſenſe which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> here mentions, becauſe himſelf acknowledgeth in his very next anſwer, <hi>that the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, and of his righteouſneſſe to us do differ.</hi> But the Apoſtle in this verſe ſpeaks of the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, and of his righteouſneſſe to us; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the making of him to be ſin for us, and of us righteouſneſſe in him, is not formally the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Mr <hi>Eyre,</hi> 2. <q>Though the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt and of his righteouſneſſe to us, differ: yet the imputation of ſin to him, and non-imputation of it unto us, is but one and the ſame act of God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. I muſt needs ſay this is to be wiſe above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth the imputation of righteouſneſſe, and non-imputation of ſin to be one and the ſame act (differing only in reſpect of the <hi>terminus à quo &amp; ad quem) Rom. 4. 6, 8. David de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the bleſſedneſſe of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without works.—Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſin.</hi> 2. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> argued not far before, that God promiſeth nothing in his Covenant which Chriſt hath not purchaſed. But non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of ſin is the ſpecial bleſſing promiſed in the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. for the pardon of ſin, and the non-imputation of it is all one, <hi>Rom. 4. 7, 8. Ergo,</hi> it was procured in the death of Chriſt 3. According to the model of this diſtinction, the death of Chriſt procures the imputation of righteouſneſſe, but not the non-imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, that is, it procures poſitive bleſſings, but not the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of, or our deliverance from the evil and miſeries of ſin, which makes our Lord but halfe a Saviour. 4. Would Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> had told us what is that imputation of righteouſneſſe, which in its formal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:116045:151"/> includes not the non-imputation of ſin; or that non-imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, which includes not eſſentially the imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. He hath told us long ſince that both theſe are immanent and eternal acts of God, and as ſuch, the death of Chriſt procures neither: the effects of both are one and the ſame, and it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impoſſible to diſtinguiſh them in reference to their effects. It is to me a myſtery beyond comprehenſion, how that imputation which conſtitutes a ſinner righteous, ſhould yet include nothing of the non-imputation of ſin, or how ſin can be non-imputed to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet he abide unrighteous, unleſſe ſome other act concur to make him righteous.</p>
                  <p>His third anſwer is, <q>The non-imputation of ſin to us, antecedes<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> the imputation of righteouſneſſe to us in order of nature only, not of time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> That is, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt avails nothing to the non-imputing of ſin to us.

If as ſoon as death by the Law was made the puniſhment of ſin, before men had broken the Law, the Lord Jeſus had given up himſelf to death, that in caſe we ſhould ſin, his death ſhould have had the ſame effect as now it hath: in this caſe our ſin, (though then but poſſible) had been imputed unto him; for he had borne the penalty due to it, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:116045:152"/> threatened againſt it, but his righteouſneſſe had not been imputed to us, upon the ſame ſuppoſition, that we had not ſinned. In like manner, though the ſins of the elect were not in being, (I mean of all the Elect borne ſince his death) when Chriſt died; yet the full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty which could at any time grow due to them, was then in being, and determined by the Law, which puniſhment alſo (in ſumme and ſubſtance) he might and did undergo, that when we ſhould ſin, we might yet be waſhed in his blood from all our ſins. The future ſins of the Elect, Chriſt might make ſo farre preſent in himſelf, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all the penalty which they could at any time deſerve, it being not our deſert of puniſhment which obligeth him to ſuffer it, but his own voluntary ſubmiſſion to it, which makes puniſhment due to him as our Surety, before it become due to us as actual ſinners; But pardon of ſin being eſſentially the deſtruction of that very obligation, which the ſinner hath contracted upon himſelfe, doth therefore eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially ſuppoſe the ſinner and his ſin in being: though another may ſuffer for him, yet another cannot be pardoned for him, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin being a perſonal priviledge, that is, ſuch as reſts in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſinner, or nowhere. 2. And that God in the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification calleth things that are not as though they were, is no part of the Apoſtles meaning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. but to ſhew the ground of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſtedfaſt believing on God, for the obtaining of a bleſſing, to ſenſe and reaſon impoſſible, namely, that he ſhould become the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many nations, his own body, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe being dead, <hi>v.</hi> 19. The reaſon hereof was, becauſe God is he that raiſeth the dead, and is able to give being to things out of nothing, for he calleth things that are not, as if they were, therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hope believed in hope, <hi>v.</hi> 18. This is that faith through which he, and all his children in the ſame faith obtain righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Having thus at large demonſtrated the weakneſſe of the argument,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> from our Juſtification in Chriſt as a common perſon, to prove our Juſtification before faith I left this cenſure upon it, they are credulous ſoules that will be drawn by ſuch decayes as theſe into ſchiſme and faction, to the hardening and diſcomforting of more hearts in one houre, then the opinion it ſelf (ſhould it obtain) will do good to; while the world ſtands; which cenſure is of ſuch ill reſentment with Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that he hath uſed no leſſe then two leaves of paper, to wipe off the dirt, untruth, ſlander, (and what he pleaſeth) caſt upon himſelf and his Church thereby.</p>

                  <p>As to the Argument, his own deſerting it in plain ground is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough that it is too weak to bear the weight which is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and if men will embrace opinions which have no ſtronger foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, is not their own credulity in fault?

                  <p>If we are in Covenant before we believe, then we are juſtified before we believe; But we are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before we beleeve. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Argument Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> diſclaims as being none of his: at leaſt, as not being propoſed in that forme in which he dreſſed it: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon expatiates in two leaves of paper, upon the diſcourſe which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between himſelf and me, ſhewing the orderly progreſſe in which his arguments advanced, with my anſwers then given to them: to which I do not intend to digreſſe ſo far as to reply. 1. Becauſe the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:116045:153"/> 
                     <hi>Baſis</hi> and foundation of his whole Argument, as he hath now propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in print, is laid in this, that we were juſtified in Chriſts Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore, as to the ſumme, is anſwered already. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no proof of any particular branch of the Argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is propoſed again before he hath done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore muſt be anſwered hereafter. 3. Becauſe though I have altogether forgotten the order of his arguments, and of my own anſwers, yet I very well remember, that as I underſtood his argument in no other ſenſe, then as it is ſet down in my Sermon printed, ſo many things I ſpake by way of anſwer, whereof his relation takes no notice: but I muſt deſire him to take more notice of before he and I part.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer then to the foreſaid argument was double, 1. That upon ſuppoſition that we were in Covenant before we beleeve, yet would it not follow that we were juſtified before we believe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bleſſings of the Covenant have an order and dependance one upon another, and are enjoyed ſucceſſively one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> replies in the ſecond paragraph of this his ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter, and ſays, <q>That though a man be not ſanctified and glorified before faith, yet if he be in Covenant with God, <hi>i. e.</hi> one of the elect, he is certainly juſtified: For, 1. God from all eternity did will, not to puniſh his Elect, which is real Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> To this (Reader) thou muſt expect no other anſwer from me, then what I have at large given already.</p>
                  <p>2. Saith he, <q>Juſtification is the firſt benefit that doth accrew to us by the death of Chriſt, for Juſtification goes before Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</q> and faith is a part of Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I acknowledge that our Engliſh Divines, (whom I confeſſe in matters of this nature I preferre before any other) are wont to place Sanctification in order after Juſtification, which alſo is ſo plain from Scripture that it cannot be denied. But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> alſo knows that they are wont to diſtinguiſh faith and ſanctification as two things, (as the Scriptures alſo do, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 15. Acts</hi> 15. 9. and 16. 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16.) though I do not finde that they do all expreſſe this difference in the ſame manner. Should I interpoſe my own opinion, it may be I ſhould finde little thank for my labour, and therefore I ſhall ſay no more then what others have ſaid before me. 1. It being plain, that faith and holineſſe are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:116045:153"/> things in the uſe of Scripture, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould have proved and not laid it down ſo rawly without any diſtinction, that faith is a part of ſanctification. I deny it, provided I may be tried by Scripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. 2. As faith is in the underſtanding, a perſwaſion of the truth of the Goſpel, and the Promiſes of life and glory contained therein, ſo is it wont to be diſtinguiſhed from ſanctification, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2, 13. is not ſo much a part of it as a cauſe: for by how much the more ſtedfaſtly we beleeve, and ſee the glory of the Promiſes, by ſo much the more are we changed into the image of Gods holineſſe, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 3, 4. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and 7. 1. 3. As faith is in the will, an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt, that by him we may be brought unto God, it hath much the ſame difference; for as God hath made Chriſt to us ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. ſo doth faith receive him, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not properly any part of our ſanctification, but the turning of the ſoul to Chriſt, as unto a moſt ſufficient principle and authour thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. and ſo much for the exceptions againſt my firſt anſwer.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond anſwer was a flat denial of the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are in Covenant with God before we beleeve, if the phraſe of<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> being in Covenant be underſtood properly, for ſuch an intereſt in the Covenant, as gives a man right and title to the bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> proof is this. Some benefits of the Covenant, to wit, the Spirit which works faith is given us before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>My anſwer to this was large and diſtinct, though Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it ſufficiently with a deſigne of darkening the truth, and blinding the Reader, but thats no matter. I ſhewed, 1. That the word, <hi>Give,</hi> had a double ſenſe in Scripture. 1. When no receiving follows, and ſo it ſignifies no more then the Will of God conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and appointing, <hi>Acts 4. 12. Eph.</hi> 1. 22. and 4. 11. 2. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it includes a receiving and poſſeſſion of the thing given: Thus the Spirit is given when we receive him, and are as it were poſſeſt of him, and he dwells in us. In this ſenſe is the Spirit never ſaid to be <hi>given</hi> in Scripture, but unto them that do beleeve, <hi>Luke 11. 13. Gal. 3. 14. Eph.</hi> 3. 16, 17. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. 11.</p>
                  <p>2 I ſhewed alſo that the Spirit may be ſaid to be given three ways: eſſentially, perſonally, or in regard to ſome peculiar operations which he worketh in us. Now there being no peculiar work of grace before faith it ſelf, which may not be wrought in an hypocrite (which hath not the Spirit) as well as in a childe of God, therefore the Spirit
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:116045:154"/> is neither given nor received before faith be wrought, but is given and received together with faith and not before. This is the ſumme, the further explication the Reader may ſee in my Sermon at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> thus expounds the giving of the Spirit, <q>That God according to his gracious Covenant, doth in his appointed time give or ſend his Spirit in the preaching of the Goſpel, to work faith in all thoſe that are ordained to life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Then ſee (<hi>Reader</hi>) what a proof we have, that the Spirit is given us before faith. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould prove, that we have ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the Covenant before faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it, he tells us the Spirit is given before faith, not in that ſenſe in which the word <hi>give</hi> or <hi>given</hi> includes our <hi>receiving,</hi> but as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the ſending or conſtituting of the Spirit, to be by way of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty the efficient cauſe or worker of faith. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth not ſo much as open his mouth againſt what I ſaid before, that the Spirit is ſaid to be given to us in reference to ſome peculiar work of his upon or in us, which work is faith. Here when he ſhould ſhew how he is given us before faith, he ſays, he is ſent to work faith; in which ſenſe the Spirit may be ſaid to be <hi>given</hi> in the firſt ſenſe mentioned of that word, but not given to us, ſo as that we can be therefore ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> becauſe he is ſent to work faith; and therefore this is but a deſerting of the Argument in hand; nor are we yet proved to have received any benefit of the Covenant (I mean, any ſaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit) before faith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers ſecondly, <q>That though the Spirit be not given us one atome of time before faith, yet it is enough<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> that it hath a precedency in order of nature, though not of time, and that faith is not before the Spirit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Neither, for if the Spirit be not ſaid to be given to us, but in reference to his working of faith in us, then faith is wrought in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before the Spirit can be ſaid to be given to us: as if the Sunne be ſaid to dwell or be in my houſe, becauſe it enlightens my houſe, then in order of nature my houſe is firſt enlightened before the Sun can be ſaid to be or dwell in it.</p>
                  <p>There is but one thing more in this Chapter that needs anſwer: and that is this; I had ſaid the Spirit is not given us, but in reference to ſome peculiar operation of his; working faith in us, and added for illuſtration, that as a man doth firſt build himſelf an houſe, and then dwell in it: ſo Chriſt by his Spirit, doth build, organize, and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:116045:154"/> prepare the ſoul to be a houſe unto himſelf, and then dwells in it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers, <q>But is not that organizing preparing act of the Spirit one benefit of the Covenant? and is not the Spirit in that act the cauſe of faith?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> If theſe interrogations have the force of an affirmation, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould have proved them, and not barely aſſerted them. I have anſwered ſufficiently already. There is no peculiar work of grace before faith it ſelf, which may not be wrought in a hypocrite, (who hath not the Spirit,) as well as in a childe of God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there can be no work of the Spirit before faith it ſelf, in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Spirit can be ſaid to be given to us. Preparative works do not difference a beleever from an hypocrite, and therefore in themſelves are no fruit or benefit of the Covenant.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:116045:155"/> is not given to us by vertue of the Covenant made with us, but by vertue of the Covenant made with Chriſt; God hath promiſed Chriſt that ſinners ſhall beleeve on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. and 55. 4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. and 110. 3. <hi>Matth. 12. 21. Pſal.</hi> 89. 25, 26. &amp;c. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> diſputes largely, that faith is given to the Elect by vertue of the Covenant made with them: the ſenſe of which we have already explained, that the Elect are ſuppoſed to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God before they beleeve, and ſo God obliged to them by Covenant to give them faith. I deny it. See we what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> brings for proof of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, a ſimilitude at the end of his firſt ſection. <q>If one promiſe<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> another, that in caſe he ſhall bear ſo many ſtripes, or perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other condition, he will then take care of and provide for his children, doth not this promiſe made with the father, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to his children? The caſe is the ſame between Chriſt and us: He performed the condition, and we receive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the New Covenant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether the caſe be the ſame between Chriſt and us, is the proper debate of the next Argument: in the mean time this compariſon is not to our caſe, becauſe the Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe made to Chriſt, that Jews and Gentiles ſhal come into him by faith; is a promiſe that he ſhall have children ſpiritual; that he ſhall have a numerous ſeed, even like the ſtars of heaven for multitude. But as the promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> concerning the multitudes of children which he ſhould have, was no promiſe to them that they ſhould becom children (which were promiſe to nothing, that it ſhould become ſomething) ſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Chriſt, that many Nations ſhall come unto him, and becom children to him in a ſpiritual ſenſe, is no promiſe to them, nor have they thereby any right given them to be made believers; but unto him, and <hi>in gratiam ſui,</hi> for his own honour and glory. Much leſſe doth ſuch a promiſe hinder, that that faith by which they become children unto Chriſt, may not be enjoyned them as the condition upon which they are to partake in Chriſt and bleſſedneſſe by him.</p>
                  <p>The ſerond and great Argument is this, <q>If there be but one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of grace, which is made both with Chriſt and us, then faith is given us by vertue of the Covenant made with us. But there is but one Covenant of grace made both with Chriſt and us. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Hence, a little before I am bid to ſhew that there are two diſtinct Covenants of grace, one made with Chriſt, and the other
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:116045:155"/> with us, or that there is any other Covenant made with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, then that which is made with Chriſt, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before we can give a diſtinct anſwer, to this we muſt firſt enquire how we may conceive of the forme and tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. The tenour of the Covenant of works is plain and intelligible, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> But (it ſeems) there is no Covenant of grace made with men at all (though ſome men are the intended objects of the bleſſings therein contained) but only with Chriſt: with whom we are to conceive the father ſtriking a Covenant to this ſenſe: <hi>If thou wilt make, or do thou make ſatisfaction for the ſins of the Elect, and I will give them grace and glory;</hi> where the condition is Chriſts death, or rather his ſatisfaction, (for his death, if it had not been ſatisfactory, had availed nothing) and the promiſe is, that the Elect ſhall have grace and glory. This being explained I do utterly deny, that there is but one Covenant of grace made both with Chriſt and us, which is Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Aſſumption.</p>
                  <p>And 1. I deſire Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to reflect a little upon his own principles,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> and tell me, whether pardon of ſin be a bleſſing which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in his Covenant to give, or the condition which Chriſt was to perform? The former out of queſtion, if Scripture may be Judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17. But whether Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will allow it, or how he can allow it I cannot tell. We have ſeen him before very peremptory in theſe two aſſertions. 1. That the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt, is formally the non-imputation of them unto us. 2. That Chriſts ſatisfaction was (formally) the payment of our debt, and ſo muſt needs diſcharge us <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> becauſe the diſcharge of the debt is formally the diſcharge of the debtour. How theſe principles claſh one with another we have ſhewed already, (for Gods act in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Chriſt, is in nature before his bearing it, or ſatisfying by bearing it; as action is in nature before paſſion. If then Gods act in imputing our ſins to Chriſt, (that is, puniſhing them in him) be formally the non-imputing, (that is, the pardoning) them to us, then the death of Chriſt, as it was the payment of our debt, is not the thing that diſchargeth us: and if this, then not that:) But my buſineſs now is to infer, if Chriſts death be the payment of our debt, and ſo our formal diſcharge, then our diſcharge from ſin is the condition of the Covenant of grace, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath modelled it) not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe upon the performance of the condition. The reaſon is plain, becauſe Chriſts ſatisfaction (which is the payment of our debt, and formally the diſcharge of the debtour) is the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:116045:156"/> of grace (according to Mr. <hi>Eyre;</hi>) But that cannot be the forme or tenour of the Covenant of grace, which excludes the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin from being promiſed therein. <hi>Ergo,</hi> that is not the forme which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> preſents us with. 2. If the words aforeſaid contain the ſubſtance and tenour of the Covenant of grace, then the ſaid Covenant doth not only not require and command faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as neceſſary meanes which we are bound to, for obtaining the promiſe of life and ſalvation; But whoſoever ſhall preach ſuch a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of faith and repentance, doth in ſo doing contradict the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant of grace. The reaſon of the conſequence is plain, becauſe to the obtaining of a Promiſe made upon condition, nothing more is required then the performance of the condition. If then Chriſt hath fulfilled the condition of the Covenant of grace, nothing more can be enjoyned and required of us, to the obtaining of any bleſſing of the Covenant: and whoſoever ſhall yet preach a neceſſity of faith and repentance, as acts which we are bound to put forth that we may be ſaved, deſtroys the Covenant of grace. But both theſe are deſperate conſequences, which we ſhew thus. The Goſpel and the Covenant of grace are both one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>v. 15, 16. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 6. with <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 6, 7. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23 But the Goſpel obligeth all men to believe and repent (the elect as well as others) that they may be ſaved: and thus did the Apoſtles (the ſpecial Miniſters of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) preach whereſoever they came, <hi>Mark 16. 15, 16. Luke 24. 47. Mark 1. 14, 15. Acts</hi> 2. 38. and 3. 19. and 20. 21. and 26. 20. <hi>Rom. 10. 6, 8, 9. Col. 1. 23, 28. &amp;c. Ergo,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace requires faith and repentance, as neceſſary in point of duty that we may be ſaved; or elſe the Apoſtle's Miniſtry had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Hence thirdly, it will be impoſſible for any man to ſin againſt the<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Goſpel or Covenant of grace, (as Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath framed it) for none can ſin againſt the Covenant, but he that is a Covenanter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto:</hi> I mean, either ſuch a one as actually is in Covenant, or elſe is bound to enter into Covenant. Now upon ſuppoſition that none are Covenanters but God and Chriſt, there can be no breach of the Covenant but on one of their parts. And conſequently, neither will it be any grace in God to preſerve the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from a final breaking of Covenant: ſuch being the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, that it is impoſſible <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> that it ſhould be broken but by God or Chriſt: nor can any by unbelief or Apoſtaſie
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:116045:156"/> violate the covenant (ſeeing it hath no preceptive part) which is ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to Scripture, <hi>Heb. 10. 29. He hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing.</hi> Hence 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. No man becomes worthy of puniſhment for breaking the covenant of grace through unbelief or Apoſtaſy (as the Apoſtle in the ſame place ſaith they do, and that moſt juſtly; and I ſhall farther ſhew when I come to it) Nor 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Is ſalvation and eternal life given <hi>as a reward</hi> to them that keep the covenant of their God: (which is contrary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Scriptures) the reaſon is, becauſe the covenant promiſeth a reward to none, but unto them that fulfill the conditions of it. If Chriſt onely fulfill the condition, then our grace and glory may be his reward: but glory is not the reward of our faith or obedience. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will ſay, yes, becauſe glory follows our faith and obedience. But though I readily acknowledge that glory is called our reward onely metaphorically, and one reaſon of the ſimilitude is that which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> mentions, becauſe glory follows our faith and obedience, as wages follows the work: yet is not that the onely, or of it ſelf a ſufficient reaſon (as we have ſhewed before) nor are the Scriptures or our Divines wont to reſt in it. The Scriptures tell us that God will reward every man according to his works, See <hi>Rom. 2. 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Gal. 6. 7. Rev. 22. 12. &amp;c.</hi> I acknowledge the ſenſe in which our Divines underſtand the words <hi>viz.</hi> that the phraſe, <hi>according to his works</hi> doth not ſignifie the proportion of deſert, but the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and agreeableneſſe between works, and the reward which God gives: if the works be good, the reward ſhall be good: if evill, the reward ſhall be evill alſo. But this is as much as I need to ſhew, that eternall life is not called a reward meerely becauſe it follows faith and obedience. For if ſo, then a beleever <hi>quatenus</hi> a beleever, or a godly man <hi>quatenus</hi> a godly man is no nearer the reward, then if he had neither faith nor godlineſſe, upon any other ſcore but this, that theſe by Gods appointment are to go before the reward. And if God had appointed that all that ſhall be ſaved ſhould live to 20 or 30 years of age, their arrivall at ſuch an age, had been every whit as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to their reward, as now their faith and godlineſſe is ſuppoſed to be. Againe? Our Divines account it no aſcribing to the deſert of<note place="margin">See Down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If this be ſo, then glory is not called a reward meerly becauſe it follows faith and Godlineſſe (for that it would do, whether thoſe graces were more or leſſe.) But wherein then (will it be ſaid) ſtands the difference between a reward
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:116045:157"/> of debt and of grace? between a reward properly ſo called, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo called metaphorically? Surely amongſt other differences this is one, that God (<hi>dignatione ſuâ</hi>) of his own grace and vouchſafeing, is pleaſed to accept of our faith and imperfect obedience, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them with eternall life, not onely above, but without all dignity and deſert in them. Whereas a reward properly ſo called, hath always reſpect to ſome work as its meritorious cauſe, from which alſo it hath its meaſure and proportion.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> expects that I ſhould have ſhewed, that<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> there was one covenant of grace made with Chriſt, and another with us; it were ſtrange if it ſhould pertaine to me to prove any ſuch thing. I thought it had layn upon Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> not onely to ſay, but to prove that the covenant of grace was made with Chriſt. It was alwayes very farre from my thoughts, that the covenant made with Chriſt, was the ſame with that which is made with ſinners: my reaſon is this. Thoſe covenants which agree not, neither in the perſons covenanting, nor in their preceptive part, nor in their promiſſory part, are not the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The covenants with Chriſt and us diſagree in all theſe. <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not the ſame. The aſſumption we prove by part. 1. They agree not in the perſons covenanting. In the former the covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are God and Chriſt: in the latter God and men. One of theſe two things I gueſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will ſay, either, 1. That though the whole covenant be not made with us, becauſe it is Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not we which performed the condition of it: yet the promiſſary part of it pertaines wholly to us: becauſe it is our bleſſedneſſe which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed therein. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is, men are not the ſubjects or perſons that joyne themſelves in covenant with the Lord (as the Scriptures ſpeak, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5.) but onely the objects concerning whom God hath ſpoken that he will do them good, even as brute, or inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may metaphorically be ſaid to be in covenant with God, when he promiſeth any bleſſing upon them for his ſervants ſake, as <hi>Hoſ. 2. v.</hi> 18. God promiſeth to make a Covenant for his people <hi>with the beaſts of the field</hi> (that they ſhall do them no hurt) and with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth, that they ſhall concurre to yeild them bleſſings, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. Or rather when God promiſeth, that the heavens and earth ſhall receive ſome farther perſection then they now have, for his childrens ſake, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 21. In this caſe theſe creatures may (but improperly) be ſaid to be in covenant with God: and (but more improperly) that God hath made a covenant with them: and the Scripture ſomewhere ſpeaketh in a language very neere it. But God
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:116045:157"/> governs men in a way ſuitable to their natures, drawing them with the cords of men: bleſſing them, not as he bleſſeth the earth, and other inanimate or bruite creatures; but beſtowing bleſſedneſſe on them as the reward of ſome former act or actions of theirs: and ſo they are not onely the <hi>objects for whom</hi> God covenanteth, but the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with whom.</hi> Now if the conſtitution of the Covenant of grace be ſuch that men are taken into it, <hi>mediante actione voluntarià,</hi> not without ſome voluntary act of their own intervening, then Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring concerning them that he will bleſſe them, is not a ſufficient ground upon which he can be ſaid to have made the covenant of grace with them. But ſuch is the conſtitution of the covenant of grace that men are taken into it, not without ſome voluntary act of their own intervening. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the aſſumption is plaine from the words of <hi>Moſes, Deut. 29. 12, 13. That thou ſhouldeſt enter</hi> (or paſſe) <hi>into covenant with the Lord thy God—that he may be unto thee a God—as he hath ſworne unto thy fathers, to</hi> Abraham, <hi>to</hi> Iſaack, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob; which to be the ſubſtance of the covenant of grace (excepting the additions and explications peculiar to the times of the goſpel) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares. 1. In that it is for ſubſtance the ſame which was made with their fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which not onely the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures witneſſe, but Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> grants, to be, for ſubſtance, the covenant of grace. The promiſe to the fathers that they ſhould have a ſeed was peculiar to themſelves: but the other bleſſings promiſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the ſeed as well as to the fathers: onely the Lord requires of them to enter into, and keep his covenant (as their fathers did) that they might inherit the bleſſing of their fathers. 2. Becauſe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant here mentioned, is expreſſely diſtinguiſhed from the covenant of the law made with them in <hi>Horeb, v. 1. The words of the covenant made with</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the land of</hi> Moab, <hi>beſide the covenant which he made with them in</hi> Horeb. 3. Becauſe the Apoſtle calls this very covenant (excepting as above excepted, the additions of grace, and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of promiſes, proper to the times of the Meſſiah) <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of faith, and the word of faith which he and</hi> other Apoſtles <hi>preached,</hi> compare <hi>chap. 30. v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8, 9</p>
                  <p>Or elſe he may ſay, that we alſo performed the condition in Chriſt. But this I think he will not ſay, becauſe he ſo diſtributes the covenant of grace into parts, as to aſcribe to Chriſt the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: to us, the receiving of the benefit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the covenant made with Chriſt, and that with us, agree<note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:116045:158"/> not in their preceptive part. Of him it was required that he ſhould make his ſoul an offering for ſin, and give his life a ranſome for many, <hi>Iſa. 53. 10. Heb.</hi> 10. 5. 7. Of us there is no ſuch thing required: but onely that we beleeve as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: ſo ſhall we pertake in the bleſſings of his covenant, <hi>Rom. 4. 23, 24. Gal. 3. 6, 7, 9, 16, 22. Heb.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14, 15. 3. The promiſes made to Chriſt in the covenant of redemption, are of a higher nature then thoſe made to us in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of reconciliation; to wit, a name above every name, whether in heaven or earth: the inheritance of all nations: dominion from ſea to ſea. See <hi>Philip. 2. 9. Heb.</hi> 1. 4. and 2. 9. and the other places mentioned, §. 1. The moſt which is promiſed to us is a conformity in our meaſure unto him in glory.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> ſecond Argument proceeds thus. <q>If Chriſt merited<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> nothing for himſelf but onely for the elect, then all the promiſes made to him do belong to them; </q>But the firſt is true. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the conſequence: becauſe though Chriſt merited nothing for himſelf, (it being unworthy to rank him amongſt ſuch mercinary ſervants, to whom nothing is due but for their labour: in which ſenſe are our Divines to be underſtood, when they deny him to have merited for himſelf) yet what he did and ſuffered was neceſſary for himſelf at leaſt as a condition, without which he had not obtained that advancement which now he hath (<hi>viz.</hi> power of ſending the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 33. dominion over Angels, in ſhort, all power, both in heaven and earth) as our Divines do liberally grant. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are not made to us, but to Chriſt: though inſtrictneſſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety he did not merit them. And therefore though I do not find that he is called his own mediatour, yet he was his <hi>own way</hi> unto the father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 4, 6. forasmuch as not without the rending of his fleſh, and the ſhedding of his own blood, he entred into the holy place. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 11, 12. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proves his conſequence in theſe words. <q>Chriſt is the mediatour of the new covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. Faith is beſtowed upon us, by virtue of that covenant whereof Chriſt is Mediatour. Now Chriſt is the Mediatour of the covenant made with us, not of a covenant made ſingly and particularly with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</q> for a man is not properly a Mediatour for himſelf.</p>

Therefore leaving it to Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> to ſhew how they prove his conſequence; let us conſider them as an argument by themſelves, the forme whereof is this. What is given us by virtue of that covenant whereof Chriſt is Mediatour, is given us by that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is made with us: the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the covenant made with us, not with himſelf.

In this ſenſe I deny the propoſition, becauſe what is given us by the efficiency of the covenant, doth not ſuppoſe us to be in covenant before our receiving it: foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the working of faith it ſelf, by which we are brought into covenant, is the effect of the covenant, or 2. <hi>Ex obligatione faederis.</hi> and ſo that is given by virtue of the covenant, which we by the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant have a right to receive, and God by the ſame covenant hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf to us, to beſtow upon us. In this ſenſe (which onely is proper to our Argument) I deny the aſſumption: becauſe there is no covenant whereof Chriſt is Mediatour, which gives any man a right to the receiving of faith, or makes it due to him that faith be given him: as I ſhall farther ſhew by and by, when I come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer to my explication of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. And that faith is given us by the righteouſneſſe and merits of Chriſt, will never prove that therefore it is given us as unto a people in covenant with God. What? may not Chriſt merit faith, that thereby we might be eſtated in the covenant? though I will alſo tell Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> that the three places he mentions, <hi>viz. 2 Pet. 1. 1. Eph. 1. 3.

                     <q>The third argument proceeds thus. If faith be given us by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue<note place="margin">§. 9</note> of that covenant, whereby juſtification, ſanctification, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:116045:159"/> and glory are beſtowed upon us, then faith is given us by virtue of that covenant which is made with us. But the firſt is true. <hi>Ergo</hi> ſo is the laſt. In the ſame covenant wherein God promiſeth to cleanſe us from our filthineſſe, to cauſe to walk in his ways, &amp;c. he promiſeth to circumciſe our hearts, to make us beleeve, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. &amp;c. Jer.</hi> 31. 34.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the aſſumption, if underſtood according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſtinction, of what is given by a covenant obligation. Till I ſee better proofe then any I meet with in Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> book (which I beleeve I never ſhall) it will never enter into my heart, that God is as much bound to give faith to ſinners and rebells, as he is to give righteouſneſſe and ſalvation to beleevers. As for the proofe out of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. I deny that God doth give righteouſneſſe, or glory by virtue; that is, by the obligation of the covenant there mentioned. The reaſon (which ſhall be farther explained by and by) is, becauſe thoſe texts do not expreſſe the forme and tenor of the covenant of grace; but onely the matter and particulars, wherein God would make the ſaid covenant, as adminiſtred in the days of Chriſt, to excell it ſelf in its adminiſtration before his coming. As for example, that it ſhall have greater efficacy in giving ability to fulfill it: and to conferre more excellent, ſpirituall and eternal bleſſings, to them that do fulfill it. But he that declares, that his purpoſe is to eſtabliſh and enact ſuch a covenant, by and according to which ſuch excellent bleſſings ſhall be given, doth not by ſuch a declaration oblige himſelf to give them: it is the covenant it ſelf enacted and eſtabliſhed, which enduceth the obligation. Wherefore the texts mentioned, do indeed declare that the effects of the new Covenant (that is of the Covenant in its new adminiſtration) ſhall be farre more excellent then of the old: but they do by no means declare that the ſaid Covenant ſhall produce theſe effects in one and the ſame way or manner. It produceth faith by its reall efficacy (as I may ſo call it) for it is the new Covenant which adminiſtreth that Spirit by which faith is wrought: and having thus brought ſouls within the bond, and made them to take hold of it ſelf, it produceth juſtification, perſeverance and ſalvation by its legall efficacy, inaſmuch as it makes theſe and all other bleſſings due to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The fourth argument ſucceeds. Faith is given by virtue<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> of that Covenant which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is given by virtue of the Covenant made with us.</p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:116045:159"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the antecedent. The reaſon is, becauſe the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Scripture, are they that do beleeve. <hi>Rom. 4. 11 16. Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 9, 26, 29. If then the promiſe be made to them that are beleevers, the thing promiſed cannot be, that they ſhall be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And therefore Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> in the proofe of his antecedent, doth palpably contradict that which he would prove. <hi>The ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>is made with all the faithfull to the end of the world, and therefore they are called the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 29. A Covenant made with the faithfull is not, that they ſhall have faith.</p>
                  <p>And ſo we come to the laſt argument, which onely was mentioned<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> by Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi> and anſwered by me in my ſermon. <q>If faith be given us by virtue of the Covenant made with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then is it given us by virtue of the Covenant made with us: for the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is the whole company of Gods elect, who are therefore called Spiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Rom. 9. 6. But faith or the Spirit which works faith, is promiſed in the Covenant made with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Jer. 31. 31. Heb. 8. 8, 9, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. will by no means prove that the elect as ſuch, are Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> (for the words may, and I think muſt be underſtood of <hi>beleevers as ſuch</hi>) yet I will have no quarrel here with Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> about his interpretation. Nevertheleſſe I do ingenuouſly confeſs to him, I am very much puzled about one objection, which it concernes him as much as me to ſee well anſwered. Suppoſe then a man ſhould ſay, that by the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is not meant the elect as ſuch, but beleevers: and that it is not faith which is here promiſed, but ſome greater meaſures of grace, which they that beleeve ſhould receive; above what were uſually communicated before the times of Chriſt: he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght thus argue from the words? Whatſoever bleſſings are promiſed in the Covenant recorded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. are ſuch as are peculiar to the days of the New-Teſtament. But the giving of faith, is not peculiar to the dayes of the New-Teſtament, (for ſince ſin entred into the world, there was no other way of ſalvation then b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> faith: and therefore God gave faith in all ages to the elect.) The propoſition may not be queſtioned. For the time and ſeaſon of giving the bleſſings mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. is expreſſely determined, <hi>v. 8. Behold the dayes come when I will make a new Covenant, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 10. This is the Covenant which I will make <hi>after thoſe dayes,</hi> and in reference to theſe bleſſings in this Covenant called a <hi>better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and the promiſes thereof <hi>better,</hi> v. 6. All which prove that the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:116045:160"/> bleſſings here mentioned are ſuch as were never given before. But as the pardon promiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 12. the knowledge of God, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Gods being a God to his people, <hi>v.</hi> 10. are all more perfect then ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the ſubſtance of theſe bleſſings were alwayes the ſame: ſo, it is not the ſubſtance and being of faith which is here promiſed, but ſome more eminent degrees of grace, then ever were diſpenſed before theſe times of the New-Teſtament. Unleſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this argument better then I, the whole foundation of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſinkes, and he doth but labour in vaine to prove from theſe Texts, that faith is given us as unto a people in Covenant with God before our receiving it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe other reaſons preponderate with me to cleave to my<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> former interpretation: and therefore yeelding that faith it ſelf is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in this Covenant, I deny Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> aſſumption, underſtood in the ſenſe often mentioned. <hi>viz,</hi> That faith is given by the obligation of that Covenant, in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſuppoſed to be before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. To the Texts mentioned for proofe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. I gave a double anſwer. 1. By retortion. That if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> urge the words of theſe Texts rigorouſly, they will prove more then he would have. This he hopes is no hurt. But as they ſay in Logick, that thoſe Syllogiſmes are fallacious which, though they conclude true, yet in the ſame forme will conclude falſe: ſo is that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture to be ſuſpected, which though it may ſerve a mans purpoſe, will yet, if received carry him beyond his purpoſe to that which he will not grant. That which it proves more then I thought Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> would have granted, I delivered in theſe words. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that this covenant containes a promiſe, of ſending Chriſt to dye for our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. 15, 16. So that we may as well inferre from hence that we are in Covenant with God before the death of the mediatour, as that we are in Covenant before we beleeve: and then his death ſhall ſerve not to obtaine all, or any of the bleſſings of the Covenant, but onely (as the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cinians</hi>) to declare and confirme to us, that we may beleeve, that God of his own good will, without expecting any ſatisfaction, will do all this good for us, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> firſt anſwer, is but a repetition of his argument now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate: and is more particularly anſwered below. Two things he ſayes to it. 1. <q>That it is not manifeſt that theſe texts containe a promiſe of ſending Chriſt to dye for us. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 15. mentions the Covenant, not to prove, that God would ſend his Son to dye:</q> but that being come he hath offered up a perfect ſacrifice, <hi>v,</hi> 10, 12, 14.</p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:116045:160"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The words are theſe, <hi>v. 14, 15. By one offering he hath perfected for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them that are ſanctified, whereof the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſſe to us.</hi> And then quotes, or rather cites the words of <hi>Jeremy;</hi> Now if the Holy Ghoſt in that place of <hi>Jeremy</hi> do witneſſe; that Chriſt by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, ſhould for ever perfect them that are ſanctified: then doth he alſo teſtifie, that Chriſt ſhould come at the time there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to be made a ſacrifice: and the coming of Chriſt, though it be not expreſſed, yet is included and underſtood, as promiſed in that Covenant. Yea, and all the promiſes or predictions of the glory of the Church in the New-Teſtament, above it ſelf under the old, do ſignally include the promiſe of Chriſt himſelf as the Author of that glory and perfection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <q>He ownes it as an undenyable truth; that the new<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> Covenant was made with all the elect in Chriſt,</q> before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world were laid: it being the fixed and immutable will of God, <q>concerning all thoſe good things which in time were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them. Therefore it is called an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. As it ſhall have no end, ſo it had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> It is very ſtrange to me, that the <hi>New Covenant</hi> ſhould be now diſcovered to be older then the world: and that at no leſſe diſtance, then there is between time and eternity. And more ſtrange, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould tell us <hi>gratis,</hi> that it is Gods immutable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without ſo much as pretending the leaſt jot from Scripture; where either the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which we are wont to render Covenant or Teſtament, may be taken in ſuch a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: which appeare not, either in the Old or New-Teſtament (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe where they are uſed Metonymically, or Metaphorically, or other wayes tropically) in any other ſenſe, then of a Law, or a Teſtament, or a Convention. And moſt ſtrange, that he ſhould alſo tell us <hi>gratis</hi> that it is called an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. not onely <hi>a parte poſt,</hi> but <hi>a parte ante,</hi> not onely as hauing no end, but alſo as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beginning: when the Hebrew word will by no means enforce it: and it is moſt certaine, that that Covenant made with <hi>David</hi> had a beginning, recorded, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 16, 19. and all the places mentioned in the margine, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. &amp;c. Do alſo ſpeak of ſuch everlaſting Covenants, as we know were not without beginning. And whereas Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth afterwards acknowledge, that notwithſtanding this Covenant be eternall; yet there are more eſpecially three periods of time, wherein God may be ſaid to make this Covenant with us.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:116045:161"/> As 1. Immediately upon the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. At the death of Chriſt. 3. When God beſtowes on men the benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If we are properly in Covenant from eternity, there is no act of God in time by which we are brought into Covenant: <hi>nihil agit in ſimile,</hi> therefore theſe three periods of time, are but three degrees of manifeſtation that we are in Covenant. Accordingly, as I argued before in the matter of Juſtification, ſo now in the matter of the Covenant. If the Covenant of grace conſiſt eſſentially in Gods eternal purpoſe of bleſſing the elect, then is not the word Covenant (that Covenant I mean by which the elect are ſaved) taken properly in all the Scriptures: foraſmuch as it no where ſignifies the foreſaid purpoſe. A thing as incredible and abominable as the former.</p>
                  <p>But let us farther examine this <hi>undenyable truth.</hi> If the foreſaid<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> purpoſe of God be the Covenant of grace, then Chriſt did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by his death that God ſhould make a Covenant with the elect. But the conſequence is falſe (and Socinianiſme) <hi>Ergo</hi> ſo is the Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. <q>Though we do not ſay that Chriſt procured the Covenant (he might have added, and therein we agree with the Socinians) yet we ſay, the effects of the Covenant, or the mercies themſelves,</q> were all of them obtained by the blood of Chriſt; as deliverance from the curſe, inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Such a ſalve for the honour of Chriſts merits, I remember we had before in the matter of Juſtification. <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt merited the effects of Juſtification, not the act: even as he merited the effects of election, but not the act. As if the reaſon were the ſame between a particular univocall cauſe (ſuch as Juſtification is) determined to a particular kind of effect (which cauſes do alwayes produce their effects immediately, without the intervention of any other cauſe:) and an univerſal cauſe of ſeverall heterogeneous effects (ſuch as electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is) and therefore produceth nothing but by the ſub-ſerviency of thoſe ſeverall kinds of cauſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ordained to their ſeverall kinds of works; But the like diſtinction here, between the Covenant and its effects is of worſe conſequence if I miſtake not. Therefore againſt Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer, I have theſe things to object. 1. It makes void the death of Chriſt: for if the elect, before the death of Chriſt, haue a foederall right to the bleſſings of the Covenant, then they are righteous before his death: (for to be <hi>righteous</hi> by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:116045:161"/> imputed, <hi>and to have right to bleſſedneſſe</hi> are inſe parable.) But Chriſt is dead in vain if righteouſneſſe comes by any other way or cauſe then his death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. 2. If the Elect are in Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of the Mediatour, they muſt have the bleſſings of the Covenant whether he die or no; for every Covenant induceth an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in point of faithfulneſſe (at leaſt) upon the Covenanter to fulfill his Covenant. If then God have made a Covenant before the death of Chriſt with the Elect, what ſhould hinder their receiving theſe bleſſings without his death? Either God is unable to fulfill his covenant: (but he is Almighty,) or he is unfaithful, (but he is a God that keepeth covenant:) or our ſin hinders, (but he hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted before the death of Chriſt, that ſin ſhall not hinder: for pardon of ſin is a ſpecial branch of the covenant.) Or finally he hath covenanted to give us theſe bleſſings through the death of Chriſt, and no otherwiſe. But then we are not in covenant before the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts death: and beſides, (which I moſt ſtick at) then the whole reaſon why God ſhould puniſh his deare and only Sonne ſo grievouſly is this, it was his pleaſure ſo to do. But ſurely he that doth not afflict men meerly <hi>becauſe he will,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. would much leſſe deal ſo with his Son. 3. Either Chriſt and his merits are part of the bleſſings of this covenant, or no. If they be, then it is falſe that Chriſt merits all the effects and bleſſings of the covenant: for he did not merit that himſelf might merit, or be by his death the meritorious cauſe of our bleſſings. If not, then the New-Covenant is never a whit better or more excellent then the Old. The firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was faulty, becauſe it could not bring ſinners to perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. and 7. 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. If the New-Covenant cannot give us the bleſſedneſſe it promiſeth, unleſſe Chriſt merit and bring forth the effects thereof, then is it altogether as impotent and unprofitable as the old: a faire advancement of the Covenant of Grace. 4. Nor can I conceive how this eternal Covenant can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath hitherto been diſputing for, <hi>viz.</hi> That the New Covenant was made with Chriſt: he performed the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and we receive the benefit. Chriſts death was either the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant, or of the effect of it. Not the former, if it conſiſt in Gods purpoſe; Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows how our Divines diſguſt a conditional purpoſe in God. And how it ſhould be the condition of the effects, when it is not the condition of the Covenant it ſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach. I know Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will tell me that there are no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods purpoſe, and yet there may be and are conditions of the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:116045:162"/> things purpoſed: But then that purpoſe is not a covenanr properly ſo called: Metaphorically, it may be, it may ſo be called: but then it is ſuch a Covenant as is neither made with man nor with Chriſt, but with God himſelf: being no more then his own reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on within himſelf. And yet the foreſaid poſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That there are no conditions of Gods purpoſe, though there are cauſes of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the things purpoſed, had need of a diſtinction too; for ſo farre forth as they are the effects of purpoſe, they have no other cauſe or condition: and ſo farre forth as they have other conditions or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are not the effects of purpoſe. The exiſtence and order of the things purpoſed is from Gods purpoſe. For example, he did purpoſe that firſt he would give up his Sonne to death for us, then call us, then juſtifie us, then glorifie us, and had there been nothing elſe but Gods purpoſe, theſe foure had been the ſimple ſucceſſive effects of his purpoſe; but had not had the relation of cauſe and effect amongſt themſelves. That Chriſts death merits our ſalvation is not from Gods purpoſe, but from the convention between the Father and him. That faith is the condition of juſtification, and glorification is from the promiſe of grace made with us: That glorification is alſo a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is from the ſame promiſe: That it is not only a conſequent but an effect of our juſtification, ariſeth from the nature of that act, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an adjudging unto glory: that it is an inheritance, is becauſe it is given by Teſtament. Wherefore all theſe purpoſed acts of God may be conſidered, either ſimply, <hi>ratione exiſtentiae,</hi> in reſpect of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and ſo they have no other cauſe but his purpoſe: or <hi>quoad modum eſſendi,</hi> according to that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> habitude or relation which they have one to another in their execution, ariſing either from the nature of the things themſelves, or ſome Law, Covenant and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of God; and thus they are not the effects of his purpoſe. But I have been two long in my reply to this anſwer of Mr. <hi>Eyres:</hi> A word more to prove that Gods eternal purpoſe is not the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and I paſſe on.</p>
                  <p>That Covenant which is of the ſame common nature with thoſe<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> Covenants that are wont to be made amongſt men, doth not conſiſt<note place="margin">

The New Covenant or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is of the ſame common nature with thoſe that are wont to be made amongſt men. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the New Covenant doth not conſiſt in the purpoſe of Gods minde or will. The propoſition is certain. Becauſe, whether Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> will allow Gods Covenant to be a Covenant properly ſo called, or will rather call it a promiſe, it is
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:116045:162"/> certain there are no Pacts, Conventions, Covenants, Stipulations, Reſtipulations, Teſtaments, Pollicitations, Promiſes or Contracts of any kinde made amongſt men which conſiſt in the internal purpoſe of the minde: and therefore if Gods Covenant or Promiſe be of the ſame common nature with theſe, neither can that conſiſt in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

There is alſo a promiſe and declaration that God will work this condition, by which men ſhall have an intereſt in this Covenant and a right and title to the bleſſings of it. <hi>I will put my Lawes into their mindes,</hi> that is, I will give them faith: which faith is not promiſed as an effect of the Covenant already made, but as a means by which we are brought into Covenant, and thereby inveſted in a right to all the bleſſings of it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That this is the true meaning of the text (Reader) thou ſhalt ſee proved below: In the mean time (according to my promiſe) take a farther Explication of the words which I ſhall ſet down in diſtinct
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:116045:163"/> propoſitions, that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> may ſee what little ground my words afford him of all his wonderments and paratragedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. The Old and New Covenant ſo called, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and 13.<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> are not two Covenants oppoſed in their nature and ſubſtance: but one and the ſame Covenant of grace under an Old and New Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. This many learned men have proved, and our Divines ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally grant it, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> himſelfe for one in this his ſeventeenth Chapter §. 2. and therefore I ſet it downe without farther proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Therefore that which is called the New Covenant, and deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12. doth not containe the form and tenour of the Covenant of grace; but only the differences between the Old Covenant and the New, and the matter wherein the latter excells the former. And that the name of a Covenant is given to it, doth not alter the caſe: it being ſo frequent in Scripture to uſe the name of <hi>Covenant,</hi> when not the forme, but the matter or quality and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it is ſignified, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 14. Rom. 9. 4. 1 King. 8. 21. Hoſ. 2. 18. Job 5. 23, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. The differences between the Old Covenant on the one ſide, and the new on the other are thus ſtated in the text. The Old in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is called <hi>faulty,</hi> ver. 7, 8. and the faultineſſe of it deſcribed in two particulars. 1. That it could not give ſtrength and ability to the people to fulfill it, and by conſequence, 2. That it could not make them bleſſed in the favour and enjoyment of God, <hi>ver. 9. They continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</hi> In reſpect of which it is elſewhere called <hi>weak and unprofitable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make any thing perfect, chap.</hi> 7. 18, 19. compare alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. On the contrary, the New Covenant in general is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>better,</hi> ver. 6. and its betterneſſe (beare with the Angliciſme) expreſſed in two oppoſite reſpects. 1. That it ſhould miniſter abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſtrength to keep Covenant. 2. And by conſequence perfect the people in the favour and enjoyment of God, <hi>ver. 10. I will put my Lawes into their minde.—And I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> The former of which is farther illuſtrated, <hi>ver. 11. They ſhall all know me, &amp;c.</hi> and the latter, <hi>ver. 12. I will be mercifull to their unrighteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Hence the new Covenant is elſewhere called <hi>a miniſtration of the Spirit, Life and righteouſneſſe, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. From what hath been ſaid it appeares, that the Apoſtle in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:116045:163"/> this place is ſo far from denying the Covenant of Grace (formally ſo taken) to have any conditions, as that he doth plainly ſuppoſe the contrary. 1. In that he ſaith the New Covenant hath its Lawes as well as the Old, <hi>ver. 6. He is the Mediatour of a better Covenant eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon better promiſes,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, enacted. The word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that the New Covenant is alſo a Law requiring ſomething of us; that we may obtain the bleſſings of it: though it be enacted upon <hi>better promiſes:</hi> it being promiſed long before, that this Covenant ſhould make us perfect, and not the former. 2. Becauſe one great part of the perfection of this Covenant conſiſts in this, that it ſhould have vertue to enable us to keep it, or to preſerve us from breaking it, (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> brake the former) which were no perfection at all, if the ſaid Covenant had no condition in it which we were bound to keep. Let us now ſee what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> objects againſt my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he denyes. <q>That the whole matter, and all the benefits of<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> the Covenant on Gods part are confined to thoſe words,</q> 
                     <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> 
                     <q>That promiſe being not put alone, but with other promiſes, denotes one particular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> The contrary is evident from the oppoſition here made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the old Covenant and the New. <hi>For I will be their God</hi> (in the new Covenant) is directly oppoſed to, <hi>I regarded them not</hi> (in the old.) Therefore as Gods <hi>not regarding</hi> them, was not one particular evil, but containes all the miſeries which befell them for their breach of that Covenant: ſo on the contrary, <hi>I will be their God</hi> containes all the comfort and bleſſedneſſe which is given them by this. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt frequent ſenſe in which that phraſe (<hi>I will be their God</hi>) is uſed in Scripture, is to denote God to be a benefactor liberally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whatſoever pertaines, adde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the welfare and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his people, <hi>Pſal. 144. 15. Exod. 3. 15. Rev. 21. 7.

Nor can I find it ſo much as once in all the Scriptures, whether by it ſelf or joyned with other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, where, with any ſhew of reaſon, it can be confined to one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular benefit. Nor doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> pretend any Scripture for it, but his own word only. But what is that one particular bleſſing which it muſt denote?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Either (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) the formal part of mans happineſs which conſiſts in the fruition and enjoyment of God.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But that cannot be the meaning here, becauſe then, God by the New Covenant is not the God of any while they live in this world, which though it be true in regard of the perfection and full enjoyment of thoſe bleſſings which God promiſeth, when he ſayes, <hi>I will be their God:</hi> yet in reſpect of all degrees of enjoyment it is falſe for in the New Covenant he promiſeth the pardon of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 12. which is a ſpeciall bleſſing contained in the ſaid words, <hi>I will be their God,</hi> Rom. 3. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Or 2. (ſaith he) <q>It relates to the knowledge of our intereſt and propriety in him. Thus, <hi>I will be their God,</hi> is as much as,</q> they ſhall know that I am their God, and that they are my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Nor can this be the meaning. 1. Either this knowledge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the experience of <hi>Gods being their God:</hi> and then we are to ſeek, as much as before, what it is for God to be their God. Or from partaking in ſome other bleſſings, mentioned in this deſcription of the New Covenant: and then that grand promiſe, <hi>I will be their God,</hi> promiſeth juſt nothing upon the matter, for if the meaning be, ſuch and ſuch bleſſings will I give them, and thereby they ſhall know that <hi>I am their God:</hi> this promiſeth nothing; but only declares how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thoſe benefits ſhall be, ſuch as ſhall evidence plainly that <hi>God is their God:</hi> and thus the grand pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iſe of grace will be made a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 2. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould alſo have taken ſome paines to allay the harſhneſſe of his interpretation. <hi>I will be their God,</hi> that is, they ſhall know that I am their God. If I had taken this liberty of interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing, he had accuſed me juſtly of chopping and changing the Word of God at pleaſure. 3. When God promiſeth to be their God, he promiſeth that which is contrary to his <hi>not regarding them;</hi> But his <hi>not regarding them</hi> was not meerly his not manifeſting himſelf to them to be their God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his being their God is not meerly his making them to know that he is their God.</p>

                     <q>Or 3. (Saith he) <hi>I will be their God, &amp;c.</hi> imports as much as I will protect them, and they ſhall worſhip me.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But what is that protection? If it impart our whole delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from all ſpirituall enemies and miſeries, and the beſtowing of all good which makes us happy; then it is the thing which I contend for. If of any particular deliverance or any one particular bleſſing, ſhew us what it is: and that <hi>I will be their God</hi> is taken ſo much as once (as many ſcores of times as it is uſed in Scripture) ſo reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</p>

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Indeed the words have not the forme of a precept: nor did any man ever dreame that they had (as I know of.) But they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the New Covenant ſhall be ſo much better then the Old, as to enable us to fulfill the precept and condition of it, which the Old could not do: For as it was the faultineſſe and imperfection of the Old Covenant, that <hi>the people brake it:</hi> ſo is it the excellency of the new, that it ſhall enable them to fulfill it. The new covenant then hath a condition as well as the old: or elſe it hath no glory above the old in this reſpect, that it miniſtreth ſtrength to fulfill it. Is Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſatisfied now? or will he ſhew me wherein any of the Authors mentioned contradict this: though I will not be bound to juſtifie all the expreſſions of every one of them.

God promiſeth to <hi>cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes.</hi> Is it therefore no duty of ours to walk in his ſtatutes? In the ſame chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 26. he promiſeth to <hi>give a new heart and a new Spirit:</hi> yet are we elſewhere commanded to <hi>make as a new heart and a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31 God hath promiſed to <hi>circumciſe our hearts to love him,</hi> Deut. 30. 6. Yet is it our duty to circumciſe our hearts. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 4. And may not then faith be promiſed, and that as the condition or meanes by which we are brought into Covenant?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi> 2. <q>If the promiſe of faith be a part of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; then faith it ſelf is an effect of the Covenant, or a benefit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by virtue of it; But the promiſe of faith, is part of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I deny the Aſſumption. The new Covenant worketh or begetteth faith, but it doth not promiſe it. Note therefore (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that there is a great difference between what is promiſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the new Covenant, and what the new Covenant promiſeth. Concerning the new Covenant, it was promiſed that it ſhould be effectual to quicken the ſoul, and cauſe it to beleeve: but it ſelf doth not promiſe to make us beleeve. If it did, foraſmuch as that can be no other then an abſolute promiſe, then God doth promiſe in the Old-Teſtament (namely <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31.) that he will promiſe faith in the New. But a promiſe to promiſe, and that to the very ſame perſons, concerning the ſame benefit, is ſo contrary to reaſon, and runs ſuch an infinite courſe of promiſing, without beginning or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it may not be admitted. But how doth Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> prove his Aſſumption? Thus. <q>All the promiſes of God do belong either to the Covenaut of works, or to the Covenant of grace.</q> The promiſe of faith is no part of the Covenant of works; <hi>Ergo,</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I deny the propoſition. The promiſe of the Covenant of grace it ſelf, Of which Covenant is it a part? of the Covenant of works? or of the Covenant of grace? not of the former, for that promiſeth no good to ſinners. Not of the latter: for the Covenant it ſelf is the thing promiſed. If then the Covenant it ſelf may be promiſed, and yet that promiſe be no part of the Covenant: may it not alſo be promiſed to be in ſuch a manner or degree more or leſſe efficacious, and perfect, and yet that promiſe in like manner be no part of the ſaid Covenant?</p>
                  <p>Hence we anſwer the third argument. <q>If the promiſe of faith
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:116045:165"/> be an effect of Chriſts death, then it is an effect of the Covenant already made: for all the effects of his death, are effects of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which was confirmed by his death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> I deny the conſequence with the proof of it. Not to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againe whether Chriſt merited the Covenant: M. <hi>Eyre</hi> here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that he <hi>confirmed</hi> it in his death; But that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the Covenant, is no part of the Covenant: for the whole Covenant is the thing confirmed; <hi>Ergo</hi> all the effects of Chriſts death are not the effects of the Covenant which God hath made with us. Yea and the preaching of the Goſpell to all nations (Gentiles as well as Jews) that they thereby might be brought into Covenant, is an effect of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 2. 16, 17. Coloſ.</hi> 1. 20. But afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means by which men may be brought into covenant, is not an effect of the covenant. In like manner, the promiſe of a better cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God would make in the dayes of Chriſt (a covenant more able, and ſucceſſefull in all reſpects) may be very well yeelded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that therefore that promiſe is alſo an effect of the Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                  <p>4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Thus he ſpeaks. <q>The Scripture no where affirmes that faith is promiſed as a means to bring us into covenant, or to inveſt us with a right and title thereunto.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Nor doth it any where ſay: that it is promiſed as a part of the Covenant already made with us. But it ſayes that in ſenſe which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> denyes, and that in this very place: ſuppoſing (which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath not hitherto denyed) that faith is included in thoſe words, I will put my laws into their minds, &amp;c. For in theſe words (as we are forced often to note) is declared the ſucceſſe of the new covenant above the old, that it ſhould enable men to beleeve; that God may be their God, and they his people. But if it were not promiſed in this place, yet the conſtant voyce of the Goſpel is; beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Which words ſhew, that faith is the means by which we obtaine the bleſſings of the Covenant. What ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> againſt it? Nothing but this: <q>we may as well make Baptiſme, Sanctification, Perſeverance, &amp;c. (to which the promiſe of ſalvation is ſometimes annexed) means to bring us into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Alas! how frigidly? where is the Scripture that ſaith, Be baptized and thou ſhalt be ſaved? or where doth it ſay to men that are ſtrangers from the covenant, perſevere and you ſhall be ſaved?
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:116045:166"/> Indeed they that have already received Chriſt, are wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to holineſſe, and perſeverance in the faith, that they may not loſe or forfeit their right, <hi>Rev. 22. 14. and 21. 7. 2 John 8.

But Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhall have meaſure preſſed down and running over, I meane, many plaine teſtimonies of Scripture where faith is promiſed as a meanes to bring us into Covenant with God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or proofe of this I mentioned many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> to all which Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> anſwer is upon the matter one and the ſame; and therefore we ſhall be brief in our reply to this chapter, becauſe one generall vindication will ſerve the turne for all. As to his firſt Paragraph, wherein he chargeth me ſo ſeverely, for ſaying, the words of the Covenant (deſcribed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31 and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.) are to this ſenſe. This is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which I will make with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when I ſhall write my Laws in their hearts, I will be their God, &amp;c. He doth but ſhew how deſirous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is of an occaſion againſt me. I told the Reader plainly in that very place, that I did not therein give the Grammaticall tranſlation of the words: (though if I had ſo <hi>rendred</hi> them, it might have been juſtified by an elleipſis of the Hebrew particle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of which there are examples good ſtore in Scripture, if it were worth while to produce them) and ſet down thoſe words for no other end, but to let the Reader know, that the very deſcription of the new covenant; as to it's matter and effects, in the ſaid texts, did ſuppoſe the forme and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:116045:166"/> tenor of it, to be ſuch as thoſe words do repreſent: having ſhewed but juſt before, that there were three things in the Covenant (as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.) of diſtinct conſideration. <hi>viz.</hi> the matter and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of it on Gods part: the bond and condition of it on our part: a promiſe and declaration that God will work this condition. Therefore while Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> oppoſeth that which he calls <hi>my rendring of</hi> the words, (though I confeſſe I am not able to dive into the ſenſe of his Argument) he ſights with his own ſhadow, when afterwards I ſay, the words will bear to be read, thus; This is the covenant which I will make, ſaith the Lord that giveth his Laws into their minds, &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> &amp;c. though neither did I ſeek any advantage from this obſervation (as I alſo plainly told the Reader) yet the whole text according to this reading, agrees wholy in ſenſe with our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore neither needed Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> to have quarrelled with me about it, nor ſhall I need to vindicate it.</p>

                        </gap>y,</hi> doth thus deſcribe the new covenant, <hi>Heb. 8. 10, This is the Covenant, which I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>after thoſe dayes ſaith the Lord: I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> In which words I told the Reader there were three things of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct conſideration. 1. The matter and bleſſings of the covenant on Gods part: in thoſe words, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. 2. The bond and condition of it on our part, and that is faith, ſignified by the writing of Gods Laws in our hearts. 3. A promiſe or Declaration, that God will work this condition. I will put my Laws into their minds. That this is the certaine, undoubted meaning of the Holy Ghoſt; we have already ſhewed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable evidence from the text it ſelf. We ſhall now confirme the ſame by comparing it with other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The firſt we mentioned was, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will put a new ſpirit
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:116045:167"/> within them, that they may walk in my ſtatutes and do them, and they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> Which is the ſumme of the covenant on Gods part. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27, 28. Againe the Lord promiſeth, <hi>that he will cleanſe and purifie them, and ſo they ſhall be his people, and he will be their God,</hi> Ezek. 37. 23. And after he had promiſed, that they ſhould walk in his judgments, and obſerve his ſtatutes, it follows, <hi>Moreover I will make a Covenant of peace with them, it ſhall be an everlaſting covenant,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me is this, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, v.</hi> 20 27. To all which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gives the ſame denyall as to the firſt. We ſhall therefore prove that in all theſe places, faith is promiſed as a means to bring us into covenant with God. And then take a view of the reaſons of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> denyall in generall, or upon particular places.</p>
                  <p>For the former, the ſubſtance of Gods covenant with men is this,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people: as not onely all the Divines which I can light on, but the Scriptures alſo, witneſſe. <hi>Deut. 29. 12, 13. That thou ſhouldeſt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God—that he may establiſh thee for a people unto himſelf, and that he may be unto thee a God.</hi> More then this we need not, nor are we cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of. And God himſelf accounts that he hath fully kept his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, when he becomes a God to a perſon or people, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 8. and therefore to be their God is the totall ſumme of the Covenant on his part. Moreover the Scriptures certifie us, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> containes all the bleſſings, which God by Covenant gives to any people, <hi>Gal. 3. 9, 14, 18. Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 16, 23, 24. But <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> was the ſumme of the covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. Exod. 3. 6. with Matth. 22. 32. &amp;c. In thoſe words therefore is contained all the bleſſings of the covenant on Gods part. Hence our Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus. If God promiſe faith for this end, that he may be our God, and we his people; then is it promiſed as a means, by which we are brought into Covenant with God. But-faith is promiſed for this end, that God may be our God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is promiſed as a means to bring us into covenant. If the aſſumption be denyed, we confirme it diverſly. 1. From the plaine ſcope of ſome places. as <hi>Ezek. 37. 23.—I will cleanſe them: So ſhall they be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> and chap. 14. 11.—<hi>That they may be no more polluted with all their tranſgreſſions, but that they may be my people, and I may be their God.</hi> Even as he is often ſaid to have brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (which ſignifies ſpiritually, the bringing of ſinners out of the darkneſſe
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:116045:167"/> and ſlavory of a ſinful condition, into the way of life, <hi>Jude v. 5.) that he might be their God,</hi> Lev. 11. 45. and 26. 45. and 25. 38. and 22. 33. Numb. 15. 41. 2 Faith is promiſed for this end, that we thereby might obtaine that, which was promiſed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God brought them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> though they obtained it not, becauſe they continued not in Gods covenant; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is promiſed as a means for this end, that God may be our God, and we his people. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the conſequence is, becauſe this was that which the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, when he brought them out of the Land of Egypt: obey my voice; ſo will I be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> Jer. 7. 23. and 11. 4. The antecedent is written with a Sun beam in the place under debate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. &amp;c. Where the writing of Gods Laws in our mind (which in ſome other of the places mentioned is called, the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a new Spirit within us, and a cauſing us to walk in his ſtatutes) is moſt apparently promiſed as a means of obtaining that good which <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the covenant made with them, <hi>in the day when the Lord took them by the hand to bring them out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; for herein lay the imperfection and <hi>faultineſſe</hi> of that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they brake it, and conſequently, <hi>that the Lord regarded them not.</hi> In oppoſition to both which it is that God promiſeth to <hi>write his Laws in their minds,</hi> and ſo <hi>to be their God,</hi> other things we referre till by and by.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a truth beyond contradiction, that the giving of the firſt grace is promiſed; not as a part of the Covenant, but as a means<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> and qualification on mans part for his entrance into covenant. Let us ſee what Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath againſt it: and firſt in generall, from §. 4. downward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Firſt he excepts againſt the fitneſſe, of my expreſſion in calling our converſion <hi>the firſt grace,</hi> which he ſaith is more properly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nf Gods eternall love, or of Chriſt himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But the queſtion is onely underſtood of the <hi>grace of God in us</hi> (which is more frequently called by the name of grace, then either of the other two, <hi>Jam. 4. 6. 2 Pet. 3. 18. Heb.</hi> 12. 28. and 13. 9. &amp;c.) The firſt of which is faith, or our converſion unto God. But even in this ſenſe (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) <q>inherent ſanctification is unduly put in the firſt place, which is a conſequent, both of juſtification and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5 6. though it be promiſed in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> before remiſſion of ſins, yet in other places it is put after it, as <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. 26. Jer.</hi> 32. 38, 39.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The former part is true of ſanctification, ſtrictly and moſt
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:116045:168"/> properly taken, for the habits of the life of holineſſe, oppoſed to the body of ſin in us. But in this ſenſe, I deny faith to be any part of ſanctification: and if Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> doth thus interpret the promiſe of writing Gods Laws in our heart, &amp;c. Then ſhall I alſo deny that faith in Chriſt is herein promiſed: but onely a greater meaſure of grace to them that beleeve: which will much advantage his cauſe. But if ſanctification be taken largely for any gracious workings of God upon the ſoul, ſo as it includes faith it ſelf; then do I deny that it is any where in Scripture put after remiſſion of ſins. The two places mentioned (for of <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. we ſpeak below) ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. Then will I ſprinkle cleane water upon you, and you ſhall be cleane, from all your filthineſſe, and from all your Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ls will I cleanſe you.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> takes it for granted that this is meant of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin: and I acknowledge that ſprinkling or waſhing with water doth ſometimes alſo include that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. But ſometimes alſo it ſignifies our regeneration or converſion unto God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. and ſo do I underſtand it in this place, for a through converſion of them from dumb Idols, to the true and living God; the former of which is more peculiarly intended, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and the latter, <hi>v.</hi> 26. my reaſon is, becauſe the cleanſing of them from their Idols, is expreſſely oppoſed to their defiling themſelves with Idols, <hi>chap. 37. 23. Neither ſhall they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>file themſelves any more with Idols—But I will cleanſe them:</hi> and that for this end that <hi>he might be their God.</hi> Which (by Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> own acknowledgment) includes remiſſion of ſin: and therefore the ſaid remiſſion is not meant by <hi>cleanſing them from their Idols:</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the ſenſe were this, I will pardon their ſin, and ſo I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their ſin. The ſecond Text is <hi>Jer. 32. 38, 39. They ſhall be my people, and I will be their God: and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may feare me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them: to which I adde the next verſe,</hi> v. 40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to do them good,</hi> &amp;c. Here indeed it cannot be denyed, but that Gods giving a heart to feare him, is mentioned after the promiſe of forgiveneſſe of ſin included (amongſt other things) in the words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, I will be their God; But though it be mentioned after, yet is it apparently mentioned as the means to this end, that God may be our God. <hi>I will give them a heart to fear me, for the good of them and of their children,</hi> The fear of God is promiſed for this end, that he may do us good: or (as <hi>v.</hi> 40.) that he may never turne away from us to do us good. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is promiſed for this end, that he may be
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:116045:168"/> our God: becauſe (as we have ſhewed before) for God to be our God is all one as to be our benefactor and to do us good. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this verſe followes the former <hi>in place or writing, not in dependance:</hi> declaring the way which God will take that he may be our God: namely, by putting his feare into our hearts: and ſo advanceth what Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> would prove from it, by overthrowing it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <q>He utterly denyes that the giving of a new heart is<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> promiſed as a means on mans part for his entrance into covenant.</q> For, 1. The Scripture no where affirmes it: and it is weakly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hence, becauſe it is ſometimes mentioned firſt in the recitall of the covenant, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether it be affirmed in Scripture, or no, I am content to referre to the judgment of any Reader that hath but underſtanding enough to ſee that two and two make foure. But we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it from hence, that the promiſe of a new heart is firſt mentioned, but that the promiſe of Gods being our God is laſt mentioned, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in the place laſt debated.) And that as the happy iſſue and upſhot of Gods giving a new heart: and becauſe it is firſt mentioned as to be given, which elſewhere is required and commanded us, for this end, that God may be our God, and we his people. And what is required of us for ſuch an end, that if God promiſe to make us do, is promiſed as a means to the ſame end.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> 2. <q>The promiſe of a new heart includes not only the firſt act of faith and repentance, but the continuance and encreaſe of theſe gifts. <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the promiſes of Sanctification are either no part of the covenant: or the ſame promiſe is both a means to bring us into covenant, and alſo a part of it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument (if it may ſo be called) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in forme. If the promiſe of a new heart include not only the firſt act of faith and repentance, but the continuance and increaſe of theſe gifts, then the new heart is not promiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a means of our entrance into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. If this be not the ſcope of the Argument, it doth not touch the queſtion: if it be, I deny the conſequence. The being or firſt act of faith and repentance is promiſed as the means by which we enter into covenant: the continuance of theſe as the means by which we continue in covenant, which continuance nevertheleſſe is part of the Covenant made with them that believe: for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hath ſhall be given and he ſhall have more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:116045:169"/>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre, 3. The promiſes of ſanctification have the ſame ground,</hi> viz. <hi>The merit of Chriſt: the ſame end,</hi> viz. <hi>Gods glory. Faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are not promiſed only ſubſerviently for our benefit, but for Gods glory.</hi> Tit. 2. 14. 1 Theſſ. 4. 3. <hi>The ſame manner in which they are promiſed: he doth nor ſay I will write my Lawes in their hearts, that I may pardon their ſins:</hi> but, <hi>I will write my Lawes, &amp;c. and their ſins and their iniquities I will remember no more;</hi> Ergo, <hi>they are parts of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If all this were granted, yet I cannot ſee how this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concludes; God promiſeth to make a New Covenant: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s promiſe hath the ſame ground and end, &amp;c. with the covenant it ſelf; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the promiſe of making the New Covenant is part of the New Covenant; Will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> allow of this? 2. The maine thing alſo is left out in the enumeration. The promiſe of faith is an act of Gods Dominion and Liberty (at leaſt as to us) <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of righteouſneſſe and ſalvation is the act of God as a mercifull Governour, Judge, and Rewarder of his people, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Jam.</hi> 4. 12. Who by theſe promiſes envites, encourageth, and drawes men to beleive. 3. As to the particulars mentioned, the firſt of them hath been anſwered often. The ſecond affords a canvaſe worthy of a deeper head then mine, <hi>viz.</hi> whether repentance (for example) have any other preciouſneſſe, excellency, or bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it in it, then as it is a means appointed of God, by which we obtaine precious and excellent promiſes? The queſtion is the ſame concerning faith in Chriſt, as it is an affiance placed in him for life and ſalvation. Neither of theſe were any part of that ſoul-perfection in which man was at firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: neither any part of that Image of God unto which we are by Chriſt reſtored, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 24. Neither any part of our happineſſe, though the way thereto. (For they ſhall both ceaſe in heaven.) Neither propoſed to us in the Goſpel, <hi>ut propter ſe appetibile, ſed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aliud.</hi> Indeed it is good to repent (and now of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation) but it were better (if it were poſſible) to do nothing for which a man need to repent. If then the whole benefit of theſe acts lay in the uſe to which God hath ordained them, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which are made to them, then it will be apparent that God hath not promiſed them any otherwiſe then as meanes of obtaining the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſings of his Covenant. But I will not be peremptory. 4. To the laſt, indeed it is not ſaid that God doth write his Lawes in our hearts that he may pardon our ſins: and good reaſon why? Becauſe the ſcope of the place is only to declare what ſhall be the effects of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:116045:169"/> Covenant, not the <hi>manner</hi> in which it doth produce them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, that the pardon of ſin is one end of Gods writing his Lawes in our minde is apparent. 1. Becauſe (as we have ſhewed already) God is ſaid in Scripture to write his Lawes in our mindes, or to give us a new heart, that he may be our God: which promiſe (as we have proved, and Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> confeſſeth) includes the pardon of ſin. 2. From the contrary effects on them that are without, <hi>Mark 4. 12. That they may not perceive—nor underſtand; leſt at any time they ſhould be converted, and their ſins ſhould be forgiven them.</hi> 3. God expecteth repentance that he may forgive ſinnes, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 36. 3. and 26. 2, 3. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he promiſeth it as a meanes to the ſame end.</p>
                  <p>His third and laſt general Argument is, <hi>It ſounds harſhly that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>

Upon the former I ſhall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert nothing, having ſo largely already confuted it. This only I obſerve, that he calls the New Covenant an engagement, and that by word or promiſe: and diſtributes the Covenants of God into that of works, made with <hi>Adam:</hi> and that of grace made (not with men) but with Chriſt: and yet, not farre before placed the very eſſence of the Covenant in Gods eternal purpoſe of doing good to the Elect.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is anſwered already. In theſe and the like places, not
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:116045:171"/> the forme and tenour, but the quality, vertue and effects of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are deſcribed, 2. And ſo deſcribed as that a condition is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed: becauſe one effect of the Covenant is, to give ſtrength to fulfill it. 3. The tenour of the Covenant is elſewhere deſcribed as manifeſtly conditional for the word of faith which the Apoſtles preached is the New Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. But the tenour of the word of faith which the Apoſtles preached is this, <hi>If thou believe thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Rom. 10. 8, 9. Again, the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt is conditional. The New Covenant is a promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument is this. <q>All thoſe Covenants which God<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> made to prefigure this Covenant, were free and abſolute without any condition. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Covenant it ſelf is much more ſo. The Antecedent Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proves, in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. with <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 11. with <hi>Phinehas,</hi> Num. 25. with <hi>David,</hi> 1 Samuel 13. 13, 14. <hi>Iſaiah 54. 3. Pſalme</hi> 89. 20.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Covenant may be called abſolute, either antecedently, when in its eſſentiall conſtitution it hath no condition, neither requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor ſuppoſed, expreſſed nor underſtood. Or conſequently, when it becomes abſolute upon the performance of the condition. In this latter ſenſe I yield the Covenants mentioned to have been abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: In the former I deny it, becauſe the faith of the parties with whom thoſe Covenants were made, was ſuppoſed and in being, before thoſe promiſes were given them, and that as the ground and reaſon (though not the cauſe) of their being given them. This doth the Scripture teſtifie of every one of them, of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6. 18. with 7. 1. <hi>But with thee will I eſtabliſh my Covenant, for thee have I ſeen righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before me in this generation.</hi> Whence he is ſaid to be <hi>heire of the righteouſneſſe which is by faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. Of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Nehem. 9. 8. <hi>Thou foundeſt his heart faithfull before thee, and madeſt a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him.</hi> See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 21, 22. Of <hi>Phineahs,</hi> Numb. 25. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore ſay, behold I give unto him my Covenant of peace—Becauſe he was zealous for hie God.</hi> Of <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13. 22, 23, 32, 33. compared, and therefore he (amongſt others) is ſaid <hi>by faish to have obtained promiſes,</hi> Heb. 11. 32, 33. Indeed faith was not in theſe Covenants propoſed to them as the condition which they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: (it needed not they being believers before:) but when God promiſeth the ſame bleſſings (in ſubſtance) to a ſinful world, as he had before done to them, it is expreſly upon condition of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:116045:171"/> the ſame faith, <hi>Romans 4. 12, 16, 23, 24. Galatians</hi> 3. 7, 9, 14. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thirdly, thus he argues. If there were any condition required<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> in the New Covenant to entitle us to the bleſſings of it, it would not be a Covenant of pure grace; To give a thing freely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally are contradictories, works and conditions which men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme are their money, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the Argument of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done. Many things we have already ſpoken from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, Divines and Lawyers to evince the falſhood of it: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more I will here adde (according to my promiſe) to the ſame purpoſe. 1. If every conditional promiſe be contrary to grace, then neither can God encourage us to any act of obedience by a promiſe of rewarding it, nor may we take encouragement to obey out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the reward, without prejudicing the Grace of God. The Reaſon is, becauſe, do thus or thus, and I will give thee this or that, is a conditional promiſe: more then ſuch a forme of words we have not to prove that God ever made a conditional promiſe. But the conſequence in both the parts of it is groſſely falſe: for God doth make conditional promiſes to encourage us to obey his will: and we are to take encouragement from them for that end. For example, he promiſeth, <hi>Lev. 26. 3, 12. If ye walk in my ſtatutes and keep my commandments, and to them,—I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> Which, that it pertaines to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as well as to the Jews, the Apoſtle expreſly teacheth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18. And from thence inferres immediately, Chap. 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> The promiſes he mentions a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Goſpel promiſes, therefore promiſes of grace. Yet out of reſpect to the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed are we to come out and ſeparate from all filthineſſe of fleſh and Spirit: and God hath given us theſe promiſes for this end. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> rejected <hi>the pleaſures of ſin, becauſe he had reſpect to the recompenſe of reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 25, 26. So <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 18. So Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. Multitudes of conditional promiſes we have in the Goſpel: which therefore ſurely are not inconſiſtent with grace, <hi>Mat. 6. 14, 15. Joh. 14. 21, 23. Rom. 8. 13. Mat. 7. 7, &amp;c.</hi> If a man promiſe another (to whom he hath no natural relation, but out of a meer deſire of his good) that he will make him heire to five hundred <hi>per annum,</hi> on condition he will go no more into an Alehouſe or into none of the <hi>Popes</hi> dominions: in ſuch a promiſe there would
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:116045:172"/> be found every thing which according to Scripture or Philoſophy (as we have ſhewed before, chap. 5.) is required to an act of grace, and yet the promiſe is conditionall. If Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhall uſe his old evaſion, and ſay, that in the places forementioned there is no propoſing of a condition, but onely a declaring of the perſons, who ſhall enjoy ſuch and ſuch bleſſings: beſides what hath been ſpoken againſt it before, I ſhall onely adde this, that then the ſaid places, and innumerable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers like them, do not declare that faith or righteouſneſſe, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any other duty, to which the promiſe is made, is any whit more acceptable to God then unbelief; or unrighteouſneſſe, or neglect of prayer: but onely that the perſon beleeving, the perſon that keeps the Commandements of Chriſt, the perſon that prayeth, &amp;c. is more acceptable to God, then he that doth not theſe things: which is ſuch a prodigious aſſertion, that till I know whether Mr. <hi>Eyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> will own it, I will not go about to confute it. 2. If the condition being performed (be it of what kind it will be) the thing promiſed do <hi>eo ipſo</hi> become a due dept, then is it unjuſt to make the full price of a thing, the condition of any contract. The reaſon is, Becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever becomes a debt by contract ſuppoſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>repaſſum</hi> (as they call it) or an equality between that which I part with, and that which I receive for it: If then the full price be the condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is bound to, then have I double as much as what I part with is worth. For if the condition had been the payment of ſix pence for what is worth a 100. l. the ſix pence being paid, it becomes by virtue of the contract, proportionable to that which is worth a 100. l. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it could not make it a due debt. If then I have in ſix pence, what is proportionable to that I part with, then if the ſaid 100. l. had been the condition of the contract, I had had double as much as that I part with is worth: becauſe the ſaid 100 l. is in it ſelf proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and againe it becomes proportionable, by being made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the contract: ſo that it hath a double proportion of worth, to that I part with for it:</p>
                  <p>In the next place Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> brings in his adverſaries as objecting<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> againſt this his third argument, and clearing themſelves from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Gods grace, though they aſſert the covenant to be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. But in none of his objectionss doth he take notice of what he might very well ſuppoſe, would be principally inſiſted upon, for wiping off his aſperſions. As 1. That the Covenant of grace is not made with righteous perſons, but with ſinners, and enemies, and children of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:116045:172"/> wrath: who if they had had their due, and the rich grace of God had not prevented, had been paſt all capacity of having any new terms of life and peace propoſed to them. 2. That the conditions required, are neither ſo much as is Gods due, nor yet ſo much as man was once able to performe: which the Apoſtle mentions as a glorious diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and the righteouſneſſe of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, 8, 9. God accepteth the heart, though in many things we ſin all. Therefore theſe conditions are ſuch as are indeed available for our good, through the acceptance of a gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull governour (as <hi>Benhadads</hi> ſervants prevailed with the merciful Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they ſupplicated for life with ſackcloth upon their loyns, and ropes about their heads, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 31, 32.) though they availe us nothing in the tryal of juſtice. But let us ſee Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> objections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he ſuppoſeth us objecting thus. <q>We aſcribe no meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> to theſe conditions, as the Papiſts do unto works. His anſwer is. 1. The Papiſts aſſert no other works and conditions to be neceſſary to juſtification and ſalvation then we do. 2. They aſcribe no more meritoriouſneſſe to works then we do: for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, that the performers of a condition may be ſaid to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the reward. 3.

                  <p>2.

But faith and repentance do onely diſpoſe us to be enriched, enlivened and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the fulneſſe and ſufficiency of another, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: even as poverty may be ſaid to commend one to a liberall man, inaſmuch as it diſpoſeth him to be a fit object for liberality to exerciſe it ſelf upon. And this is intimated in the place which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> quoated but now, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1, 2. if his expoſition of it be true. <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="342" facs="tcp:116045:174"/> the conditions which men performe, are their money, for <hi>v.</hi> 1. it is ſaid, <hi>come buy wine and milk, without money and without price,</hi> which coming, is ſaith; and this faith, as it is the condition upon which we partake in the bleſſings promiſed, is therefore metaphorically called a buying (and thus farre forth it agrees with legall conditions;) but as it is a buying <hi>without money or price,</hi> it ſuppoſeth the ſaid bleſſings to be freely given (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. it is expounded) and thus farre forth it is oppoſed to legall. This I put here, becauſe I had forgot to do it in its right place, which was, §. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſuppoſeth us thus objecting. Evangelical conditions are more facile and eaſie then legal were.</p>
                  <p>His anſwer is. <q>There can be no condition imagined more facile and feaſable then <hi>Adams</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> to abſtaine from the fruit of one tree.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. Our Divines are not wont to place the whole of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required of <hi>Adam</hi> in that one precept of not eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, any otherwiſe then ſymbolically: for as that tree had the nature of a Sacrament, and the not eating of it, a viſible profeſſion of vniverſall ſubjection unto God: ſo the eating of it was a viſible and univerſal renouncing of his authority, and of that obedience which <hi>Adam</hi> owed him. 2. The objectors (who they are I know not) have (I preſume) this ſenſe. 1. That if we compare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the acts, it is farre eaſier to beleeve, then to keep the law, and this is certaine: for <hi>de facto</hi> multitudes beleeve, who never kept the Law perfectly. 2. That it is an eaſier way of ſalvation to be ſaved onely by committing our ſelves to Chriſt in his way, that he may ſave us, then to have the whole care and burthen of ſo great a work upon our ſelves: this alſo is true; becauſe in this way our ſalvation is ſure: in the other it was uncertaine, even when man was righteous (as the event proves ſadly) and unto ſinners impoſſible 3. That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt are nothing ſo grievous to be borne, as thoſe given to the Church before his coming, this alſo is undoubted, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. 4. That faith in <hi>exercitio,</hi> or to beleeve, is farre eaſier to us, through the ſtrength of God enabling us, then it was to <hi>Adam</hi> to keep himſelf in that ſtate of righteouſneſſe in which he was made: for it is God which enables us to performe thoſe acts which himſelf hath made the conditions of our intereſt in his covenant. So (will Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſay) <hi>Adams</hi> ability to keep the Law, was given him of God. True. But 1. Not of grace, but <hi>ut naturae debita</hi> (as we maintaine againſt the Papiſts) as due to his nature, out of that common goodneſſe, which
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:116045:174"/> furniſhed every creature in its kind, with thoſe principles and abilities which were neceſſary to them for the attaining of the reſpective ends to which they were created: which if they had wanted, the work of God had been imperfect, and unlike himſelf: but the creature had been in no fault 2. The uſe and improvement of thoſe abilities was left to <hi>Adams</hi> free will, ſuppoſing that common concourſe of divine providence, without which no creature can move, in its kind, toward its own end. But to quicken us when we were dead, and reſtore loſt abilities: yea, to vegetate and maintaine them againſt contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and inclinations from within, and oppoſitions from without, is ſuch ſpecial grace as <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſtate receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.</p>

I deny the Minor, God is never ſaid in Scripture to be the God of any in reference to his eternal election of them: that being no more then a purpoſe of making them his people, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a God to them. God is not the God of them that are not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 32. Let us ſee the proofes. <q>God was the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>
                     </q> now he became their God <hi>by ſetting his love upon them and chuſing them, and by ſeparating them from other people,</hi> Deut. 7. 6, 7, 8. Lev. 20. 24, 25. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny, that either the chuſing of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. or the ſeparating of them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. are to be underſtood of eternal election; of which nevertheleſſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> pretends to be underſtood in his Major, by quoting for proof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. otherwiſe I would have denyed the Major for even in vocation (which alſo is ſometimes in Scripture called <hi>chooſing,</hi> as we have ſhewed elſewhere, God ſeparates men to himſelf from the reſt of mankind: yet will it by no means follow that therefore he is the God of ſome that believe not: for vocation is the giving of faith. As to the texts before us, it is manifeſt that the chuſing, ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. is a temporall act, for the cauſe of it is ſet down, <hi>ver. 8. Becauſe he would keep the oath which he had ſworne unto their Fathers:</hi> expreſſed more plainely, chap. 4. 37. <hi>Becauſe he loved their Fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them.</hi> So alſo chap. 10. 15. 2. Much leſſe is it ſaid, that this love or chuſing them was the thing in reſpect of which he is ſaid to be their God and they his people: but the contrary is implyed, <hi>verſe 6. The Lord thy God hath choſen thee to be a ſpecial people to himſelf above all people, &amp;c.</hi> Where the making of them to be his people (which alſo includes the correlate of becoming their God) is mentioned as the end and effect of his chuſing them: which effect, when it is wrought is eaſie to learne from <hi>Exod. 19. 5. Now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar treaſure unto me above all people.</hi>

                     <q>Again (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 8. declares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael, that they became his,</hi> whileſt they were in their blood; that he ſware unto them and entred into Covenant with them: which ſwearing, as it referres to ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:116045:175"/> underſtood of the oath which he made to Chriſt concerning the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his ſeed.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing but uncertainties. 1. It is not faire in a diſpute to ground a concluſion upon Types, unleſſe we have firme demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Antitype. Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſhould therefore prove that the words there ſpoken are not peculiar to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the letter. 2. That the ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> typified are the Elect as ſuch, and not believers as ſuch. 3. That the <hi>Iſrael</hi> there ſpoken of were his, before he entred into Covenant with them. The text is expreſſe againſt it. <hi>I entred into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine;</hi> Which way doth this prove that Gods eternall Election is the thing in reſpect of which he is our God and we his people? 4. That the ſaid Covenant was a type of the Covenant made with Chriſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>So 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of God standeth ſure—The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
                     </q> Implying, that the Election and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God doth make men his. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> knows how Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and others expound this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prove,</hi> 1. That by Gods foundation and knowledge is meant his Election and foreknowledg. 2. That his are meant of, his by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It may be meant of ſuch as are his by ſincerity of faith. 3. That if men were called his in reference to his Election of them, it muſt therefore needs be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe, as when he is ſaid to be our God and we his people.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument is this. <q>God is a God not only to his<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> people who are called and do believe, but to their ſeed, who are not called and do not yet beleeve. As the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. The promiſe is to you and your children. This is the ground of Infant Baptiſme.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not then in reference to Election that God is ſaid to be our God and we his people, for certainly all the children of faithful Parents are not elected. 2. The children of the faithful are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Covenant with their Parents, whiles by reaſon of their infant age, they are in morall conſideration, ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er parts of their parents then divided from them by a perſonal ſubſiſtence of their own,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:116045:176"/> as not being then able either to owne or reject their Fathers Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Nevertheleſſe when they come of age they muſt themſelves anſwer and fulfill the conditions of the Covenant, as their Fathers did: elſe will God call them (as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 1. 6, 9.) <hi>Lo Ammi, &amp; Lo Ruhama;</hi> ye are not my people, nor will I be your God; And thus I think are all thoſe Covenants to be underſtood, wherein God promiſeth mercy to the faithful and to their ſeed. God promiſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>David</hi> and his houſe, <hi>yet ſo that thy children take heed to their way, to walk in my Law as thou haſt walked before me,</hi> 2 Chron. 6. 16. and chap. 7. 17, 18, 19. God promiſed mercy to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: by vertue of which promiſe he was gracious to the children that had not rebelled againſt him: though the ſame promiſe profited not their Parents becauſe of their unbelief, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 39, 40. With <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1, 2. and often doth the Lord require of them to return to him, and obey his voice, that he might give them the bleſſings of their Fathers Covenant. See <hi>Lev. 26. 40, 41, 42. Deut.</hi> 29. 12, 13. and other places innumerable. In like manner the promiſe is to you and your children (ſaith <hi>Peter) Act.</hi> 2. 39. therefore are they exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized, that they and their children might continue the people of God, and partake in the full bleſſedneſſe promiſed long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now exhibited in Chriſt Jeſus. The ſame promiſe is left to all in the Church under the Goſpel, <hi>Heb. 4. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> But it concerns them to ſee that they do not fall ſhort of it through unbelief, as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks. The ſum is, God is the God of the infants of faithful Parents (in ſigne whereof they are baptized.) But they when they are grown up muſt ſee that they perſonally fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant: otherwiſe God remaines no longer their God; unleſſe it be externall, and in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adminiſtrations, which doth not concerne our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thus he argues. <q>They whom the Lord hath purchaſed<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> to be a peculiar people to himſelf, have the Lord to be their God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny this propoſition. Chriſt purchaſed his wife before he made her his wife: and he purchaſed a people out of the hands of thoſe Lords that ruled over them, (Sin, Satan, the Law,) and God himſelfe as the Judge and Executioner of his Law before he made them his people. Indeed Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells us a little below, that by the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt we were made <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. when the text ſaies no ſuch thing, but the juſt
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:116045:176"/> contrary. <hi>He gave himſelf for us that he might purifie to himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liar people zealous of good works.</hi> He might as well ſay that by the death of Chriſt immediately we are made zealous of good works, or redeemed from all iniquity, that is, made to deny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts (for that's the meaning of thoſe words here, as appears by their oppoſition to <hi>verſe</hi> 12.) That which makes us a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culiar (or a choiſe and excellent) people is Chriſts purifying us: which purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being the effect and end of his death, is ſome other act then his dying for us. Compare <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. 2. This Argument contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the firſt. There Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> argued that God was our God and we his people by the act of eternal election: if that be true, then the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Chriſt is not that which immediately makes God our God and us his people. 3. The promiſe, that God will be our God and we his people, is no effect of Chriſts death if his purchaſe immediately made, that God was our God and we his people; for what was already done could not be promiſed to be done.</p>
                  <p>But (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) <q>What a man purchaſeth he obtains a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal right and propriety in, therefore the Apoſtle concludes from hence <hi>that we are not our own but Gods,</hi> becauſe <hi>we are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A right! Why, I doubt not but God and Chriſt have a right, not onely by creation, but by redemption to the obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of all the world (at leaſt whereſoever he comes by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to challenge it) that they ſhould not live to themſelves, but ſhould wholly addict themſelves to glorifie God in their ſouls and bodies. Otherwiſe let Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tell me how men can be ſaid <hi>to deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. 2. But if this were not ſo, and that it were no ſin in men to deny the Redeemer to be their right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord (as the Apoſtle ſayes he is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9.) What hath Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gained? If I buy a piece of Land to make it a Garden an Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, or a Vineyard, 'tis neither of theſe till I have made it ſo. Or, if I purchaſe a ſervants freedome that I may make him my heire; ſome other act beſides the meer purchaſe is neceſſary that he may be my heir: In like manner, if Chriſt purchaſe ſinners, that he may purifie them and make them his peculiar people, they are not his people, nor is he their God, meerly becauſe of his purchaſe. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. We ſhall cleare all this by a diſtinction at the end of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> proceeds fourthly. <q>We receive faith it ſelf upon this<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:116045:177"/> account, becauſe we are Gods people. <hi>Ergo,</hi> God is our God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe.</q> The antecedent he proves, <hi>Gal. 4. 6. Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying Abba father.</hi> So. <hi>Iſa. 48. 17.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Antecedent. The proof is ſuch as I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have met with from a Scholar and a Divine. To <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. I deny that the <hi>Spirit of the Sonne</hi> there mentioned is to be underſtood of faith, but of that Spirit of prayer (which includes that boldneſſe, liberty and confidence ſpiritual) which God gives to them that are his Sonnes by faith; For <hi>we are the Sonnes of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith this Apoſtle, not farre before chap. 3. 26. and receive the Spirit of the Sonne through faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. a Spirit given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not a Spirit given to make men believers, <hi>Joh. 7. 38, 39. Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 8. 14, 15. for we are believers before we are Sons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 17. I conſent to <hi>Junius</hi> that the meaning is, <hi>Praeſto quod mearum eſt partium:</hi> not that they had actually believed (which ſenſe the very next <hi>ver.</hi> contradicts) but (as <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his <hi>Scholia</hi> upon the place) becauſe he had taught them, <hi>ea quae apta, vel comparata ſunt ad prodeſſendum,</hi> thoſe things which if they had obſerved, would have been very much for their profit and advantage.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre.</hi>) <q>None do or can believe and repent<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> but they to whom the Lord doth manifeſt this grace; That he is their God. <hi>Erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>His ſixth and laſt Argument is. <q>They to whom God is a Father<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and a Shepheard, have the Lord for their God.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:116045:178"/> hath converted and made his children, <hi>Junius</hi> upon the place to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Upon the ſurvey of this whole diſpute, I have onely two things to<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> obſerve. 1. That whereas I have proved the words of thoſe covenant, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people,</hi> to be a promiſe made to them that beleeve; of the many places in Scripture, where thoſe words are uſed, Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> cannot find us ſo much as one, wherein they are applyed to men that are not converted unto God. 2. His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from ſuch paſſages of Scripture, wherein men are ſometimes ſaid <hi>to be the Lords,</hi> or <hi>to be Gods,</hi> or <hi>the Lord thy God,</hi> and the like, conclude nothing, till it be proved that ſuch expreſſions imply as much and the ſame with thoſe words in the Covenant, I will be their God, &amp;c. foraſmuch as men may be ſaid to be his, and he theirs ſometimes in ſome other ſenſe then thoſe words in the Covenant ſignifie. All the earth is Gods, and all the fullneſſe thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 12, 10. 11. All men are his, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>the Lord thy God</hi> (a phraſe which God often uſeth when he ſpeaks to <hi>Iſrael</hi>) moſtly ſignifies, the God whom they profeſſed and externally worſhipped: or at leaſt, whom they ought to have worſhipped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is to be ſeen in places without number. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not every ſenſe, in which we are called his, or he ours, which will conclude him to be our God in the covenant ſenſe, <hi>Jer,</hi> 7. 23. compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. where it is plainly a promiſe of ſpiritual, eternal, univerſal and perfect bleſſedneſſe, though gradually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Accordingly, neither did I uſe any of the foreſaid texts or phraſes (though I might have uſed many with great advantage) to prove, either <hi>that I will be thy God,</hi> &amp;c. contained all the bleſſings of the covenant on Gods part, or that it is a promiſe made to them that beleeve and are converted: but thoſe plaine texts, where theſe words are ſet down ſyllabically, as the matter and ſumme of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: nor can Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> gaine any thing by the uſe of them, till he hath better reconciled the Scriptures to his cauſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the following obſervation, which I had from ſome learned Jewiſh and Chriſtian writers, <hi>viz.</hi> That God is never ſaid to be our<note place="margin">§ 10.</note> God in reference to his giving the firſt grace, but onely in reference to the bleſſings which he promiſeth to them that have faith. My memory did a little faile me in the words, but not at all in their ſenſe.

If the words be ſpoken of Jews (to whom this Epiſtle is written, chap. 1. 1.) they were externally the people of God before: and in reference to them it muſt be therefore ſomething more that is here promiſed then that they ſhall be externally the people of God. 2. If of Gentiles (whom the Apoſtle alſo includes in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25.) their condition had been happy, if the want of an externall covenant had been the worſt: and they had had right and intereſt in Chriſt and everlaſting life by ſome Covenant internall. But all gentiles equally in their gentile ſtate are <hi>ſtrangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of promiſe,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. that is, have no right to any of thoſe bleſſings which pertaine to the houſhold and City of God, <hi>v.</hi> 19. no more then Spaniards, or any other forreigners have a right to any of the priviledges, honours, preferments of the City of <hi>London,</hi> or an <hi>Indian</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> hath right to inherit with the Son of an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. 3. To be externally in covenant, is to be in covenant by viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion: and it is oppoſed to him that is in covenant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by true faith: this is the uſual ſenſe of that diſtinction; uſed by the Apoſtle (for ſubſtance) when he diſtinguiſheth between: a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> and a <hi>Jew inwardly,</hi> Rom. 2. 28, 29 if M. <hi>Eyre</hi> have here the ſame ſenſe (as he ſeemes to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What manner of people they now were, and formerly had not been, is ſet down, <hi>v. 9.

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This alſo yeelds the Argument, for hereby it is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that faith is required, as the means which we are to uſe for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other bleſſings of the covenant: and a means for obtaining good things by anothers promiſe, is, <hi>formaliſſime,</hi> a condition: faith therefore is yeelded to be the condition of obtaining pardon of ſin, and all other bleſſings beſides it ſelf; which is that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath hitherto diſputed againſt. What follows in this anſwer hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to largely already; and to what purpoſe it is mentioned here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I apprehend not.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Argument was this. The voice of the Goſpel (which<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> is the covenant of grace) is every where, <hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> in oppoſition to the covenant of works, which ſaith, do this and live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 5. 6, 9. This is the Covenant whereof Chriſt is mediatour, <hi>Heb. 9. 15, that they that are called</hi> (unto faith) <hi>ſhall receive the promiſe of the eternall inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. <q>The Goſpel properly and ſtrictly taken, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts neither in precepts, nor promiſes of the New-Teſtament, but in the declaration of theſe glad tidings, that the promiſes which God made unto his people in the Old-Teſtament, are now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This is indeed a prime part of the Goſpel; but no otherwiſe then as it tends to hold forth Chriſt Jeſus as the onely and moſt ſufficient cauſe or author of ſalvation, to as many as will beleeve on him; and therefore the whole doctrine of the Goſpel is ſummarily comprehended in this, that whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 14, 15. and 16. 15, 16. <hi>Matth. 4. 17. 23. Heb. 4, 1, 2. Act.</hi> 20. 20, 21 and a hundred other places. If the Goſpell have no precept, how are men then <hi>profeſſedly ſubject to it?</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 13. Or what is it to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>not obey</hi> the Goſpel? <hi>Rom. 10. 16. 2 Theſ. 1. 8, 1 Pet,</hi> 4. 17. But what is the direct anſwer to the Argument? This.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The command of beleeving; with the promiſe of life to beleevers are parts of our miniſtry, they are not the tenor of the Goſpell or New Covenant.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. A ſtrange anſwer: our miniſtry is the miniſtry of the Goſpell; <hi>Ergo</hi> when we command men to beleeve with a promiſe of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:116045:180"/> life, we preach the Goſpel: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch a command and promiſe are parts of the Goſpel. 2. Yea, they are the ſumme of all we preach, if we preach no more then the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom. 10. 8, 9. The word of faith which we preach,</hi> and yet ſurely the Apoſtles were miniſters of the New Covenant, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Then Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> tells us againe, that the tenor of the New Covenant is, I will put my Laws into their hearts, &amp;c. And I can but anſwer him againe, that not the tenor, but the matter of the effects of the New Covenant are there deſcribed, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>exalted to give repentance, and remiſſion of ſin to Iſrael.</hi> Is not therefore repentance to be preached in his Name for the remiſſion of ſin? or may we not ſay, repent that your ſins may be blotted out? To <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. He anſwers as to other texts formerly, that it deſcribes onely the perſons that are ſaved, but not the tearmes or means by which they do obtaine ſalvation. Seeſt thou not (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) how faith is denyed to be ſo much as the <hi>meanes</hi> of ſalvation? and no more aſcribed to it then to eating, drinking, ſleeping, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crying, or the like, which do all of them in ſome degree deſcribe the quality and condition of the perſons that ſhall be ſaved? Though I confeſſe not from that which is proper and peculiar to them; but that alters not the caſe. But of theſe things more at large before. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we have not one Scripture example of ſuch phraſe of ſpeech, ſerving onely for a deſcription.</p>
                  <p>My third Argument is this. The Covenant which is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eed<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> to every man, and every man called upon to fulfill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it (namely faith) that he may receive the bleſſings of it, is not an abſolute promiſe. The Covenant of grace is to be preached to every man, and every man called upon to fulfill the conditions of it, that he may receive the bleſſings of it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I have put it thus into forme, becauſe Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> quarrels at the forme. He yeelds,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the Goſpel or Covenant of grace ought to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every creature, <hi>Marke 16. 15. Matthew</hi> 28. 19. But denyes that the abſoluteneſſe of the New Covenant is any way inconſiſtent with this preaching; Becauſe to preach the Goſpel is no more then, 1. To publiſh that the Sonne of God is come to ſave men from their ſinnes. 2. To preſſe and exhort all men to beleeve on him. 1. With the aſſent of their minds. 2. With the embraces of the heart: to truſt, rely, and rowle themſelves upon him, for all the purchaſes of his death,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:116045:181"/> and in ſo doing, confidently to expect the fruition of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Here are words enough: but whether they tend, I can ſcarcely ſee. I muſt therefore crave leave of Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> to be better ſatisfied in the following Quaeres. 1. Whether there be any promiſe of life and ſalvation made to every man? If there be n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t; what covenant of grace it is which is preached to every man? It is a ſtrange Covenant which promiſeth nothing: the Covenant of grace conſiſts eſſentially in this, that it is the promiſe of the inheritance, <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l.</hi> 3. 18. If there be; whether that promiſe be abſolute or conditionall? If the former, every man ſhall be ſaved: if the latter, the cauſe is yeelded. If Maſter <hi>Eyre</hi> would put his aſſertions into the forme of promiſes, we might underſtand him better. If I tell a man then, that Jeſus Chriſt is come to ſave men from their ſinnes, do I promiſe him any thing or no? If I do, lets know what it is, for my part I profeſſe I cannot imagine: if not, I would ask. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Whether we require men to truſt and rely on Chriſt, or whether ſaith be required as a means to enjoy the purchaſes of Chriſts death? if we do, we preſſe men to the performance of a condition; for a means uſed by us to obtaine a benefit by anothers promiſe, is a condition, as we have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: if not, whether the ſoul do not beleeve it, knows not why nor wherefore? <hi>Paul</hi> gives a better reaſon of his faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. We knowing that a man is not juſtified, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, we have beleeved. But more of this by and by. In the meane time I perceive the reaſon why we were told ſo carefully, that the Goſpel conſiſts neither in precepts nor promiſes; and that after ſo long a diſpute, that it is an abſolute promiſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid in the minor, that every man is preſſed to fulfill the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> of the Covenant, that he may obtaine the bleſſings of it, and ſo ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 4 1. a promiſe is left us of entring into his reſt, let us feare l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſt we fall ſhort of it,</hi> viz. <hi>by unbelief,</hi> v. 2, 3. No (ſays Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) <q>The words are an exhortation to ſincerity and perſeverance in our Chriſtian profeſſion, by a ſimilitude taken from fooliſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>p.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, it is not faith, but ſincerity and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which is the condition of the promiſe. The promiſe mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is of ſuch conſtitution, as that our obtaining or not obtaining it, is ſuſpended upon our beleeving or not beleeving: ſo that if we beleeve; we obtaine it, <hi>v.</hi> 3. if we beleeve not, we looſe it; (as the unbeleevers
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:116045:181"/> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> loſt <hi>Canaan</hi>) v. 2. and chap. 3. 19. If a racer loſe the Crowne, becauſe he gives over before he comes to the goal, then his running to the goal, was the condition of his obtaining the Crowne, if it be obtained by virtue of anothers promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The major I cleared by ſeverall queſtions. 1. Whether there be<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> an abſolute promiſe made to every man, that God will give him grace?</p>
                  <p>No (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) <q>yet the generall promiſes of the Covenant are a ſufficient ground for our faith: foraſmuch as grace therein is promiſed indefinitely to ſinners.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> 1. The promiſe of giving faith can be no ground of the firſt act of faith: becauſe faith doth not receive it ſelf. But the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which is to be preached to every man, is the promiſe of that good which faith receives: (for the covenant and the promiſe, are all one in Scripture, <hi>Gal. 3. 17, 18, 21.) Ergo,</hi> the abſolute promiſe is not the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I asked, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Whether it be ſenſe to exhort men to take hold of Gods Covenant, or to enter into Covenant with God, if the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be only an abſolute promiſe on Gods part? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ſaies yes. <q>For to lay hold of the Covenant, is to take up thoſe gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which God in his Covenant hath made of himſelf to ſinners, and to reſolve not to be beaten off, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> To take hold of the Covenant in Scripture language, is to joyne our ſelves to the Lord (which is done internally by faith:) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, 5, 6. hereby do we obtaine the promiſes there mentioned: for, by faith we obtaine the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. and 6. 12. But our joyning our ſelves to the Lord, were not to take hold of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it his Covenant did not require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to joyne our ſelves to him: much leſſe could we be ſaid thereby (more then by any other act) to obtaine the promiſes of his Covenant, if the ſaid Covenant did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this our joyning as a means for that end. It is not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but naturally impoſſible, for a ſoul to reſolve not to be beaten off from God, without a promiſe and a command to lay hold of it. But neither can men by faith lay hold on that Covenant, which it ſelf promiſeth to give the very firſt act of faith: nor can they be commanded ſo to do. As to the other phraſe of <hi>entring into Covenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> underſtands it of mens viſible <hi>giving up themſelves to be the Lords people.</hi> But that giving up of a mans ſelf to God is ſurely an act of the heart: though a man may alſo with his mouth profeſſe it: and hereby we are admitted, not into a Covenant of our
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:116045:182"/> own, but into Gods Covenant: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his Covenant cannot be an abſolute promiſe, becauſe we cannot by any act of our owne be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into that.</p>
                  <p>I asked farther, whether, if the Covenant be an abſolute promiſe,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> men can be accuſed and damned for unbelief and rejecting the Goſpel? was it ever known that men ſhould be counted worthy of death, for not being the objects of an abſolute promiſe? Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> anſwers. <q>The condemnation of Reprobates doth inevitably follow upon their not being included in that Covenant which God made with Chriſt.</q> 
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> That this is nothing to the purpoſe, himſelf acknowledgeth in his next words. <q>Their excluſion from this Covenant is but an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, and not the cauſe of their deſtruction.</q> We ſeek therefore an anſwer. That's this, <q>formally the cauſe of their damnation is not their non-being the objects of Gods abſolute promiſe, but their diſobedience to the command of God,</q> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> of beleeving. <hi>Rep.</hi> But doth the Covenant command them to beleeve? If it doth, it is not an abſolute promiſe: if it doth not, their unbelief is no rejecting or violation of the Covenant (in which yet the Apoſtle placeth the heynouſneſſe of the ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29.) and therefore is not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damning: for it is not any ſin againſt the Law, but that which is called a <hi>putting from us the word of life,</hi> Act. 13. 46. <hi>a neglect of ſo great ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 2. 3. <hi>a refuſing of him that ſpeaketh from Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 25. which is peremptorily and remedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſſely damning. But if they are commanded to beleeve, I would know what? <q>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of mercy to wretched ſinners (ſaith Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi>) which all men are commanded to beleeve, both <hi>aſſenſu intellectus &amp; amplexu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis.</hi>

The queſtion then ſtill remaines, what promiſe it is wherein that mercy is offered which all men are bound to embrace under paine of damnation? Is it abſolute, or conditionall? If the latter; the cauſe is againe yeelded. Not the former. 1.

                     </gap> I cannot ſee any cauſe of damnation on mans part, in reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:116045:182"/> unbelief, if the Covenant be abſolute: nor do I everexpect that Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> or any man elſe ſhould be able to declare it.<note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>My laſt Argument was this. If the Covenant of grace be an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe, then none but wicked and ungodly men are in Covenant with God. The ſumme of the reaſon is, becauſe none elſe are capable of all the bleſſings of the abſolute promiſe; whereof converſion it ſelf is no ſmall part. This Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> ownes. Againſt him I oppoſe. If men are required to convert unto God, that he may give them the bleſſings of his Covenant, then they that are converted are more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the bleſſings of the covenant, then they that live in ſin and ungodlineſſe. But men are required to convert unto him, that he may give them the bleſſings of his covenant: for the ſubjects of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-bleſſings are not the wicked, but the godly, <hi>Neh. 1. 5. Levit. 26. 3, 9, 40, 41, 42. Pſal.</hi> 106. 4. 5. and 111. 5, 9. <hi>Deut. 7. 12. 2 Chron.</hi> 7. 17, 18. And from this Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> (if he pleaſe) may rectifie the miſtake of his ſecond anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole debate, I remaine much more conſident then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> that I ſpake nothing contrary to truth or ſoberneſſe, when I ſaid of my Sermon, that ſomething might be ſaid to it, but nothing could be anſwered: whereof I am content that any man be judge, who acknowledgeth the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and can read Engliſh. And to thoſe farther obſervations, which Mr. <hi>Eyre</hi> hath pleaſed himſelf in making upon the concluſion of my Sermon, I ſhall exerciſe ſo much ſelf-denyall as to forbear a reply, till my time and paper lie upon my hands.</p>
